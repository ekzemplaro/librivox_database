"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":7,"avg_rating":"4.43"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This was really well done. I particularly enjoyed the mix of different readers' voices within the same chapter, a choice which made understanding dialogs quite easier than usual and certainly far more entertaining. The story itself is not bad at all as the mysterious, fast-paced beginning is greatly enticing and quite teasing for the reader. Sadly enough the same can't be said about the rushed, shallow ending. Main characters have a want of characterization among them, while all the others minor characters remain barely shaped. The overall feeling of the story is good though.\nThe only regret on the reading style is the dull chanting of the last chapter where a precise cadence pattern seems to take hold of the reader voice. Each sentence of the last chapter is stubbornly chanted in the very same way, no need to tell how much that can be annoying for the listener.\nThis audiobook would deserve 5 stars if it weren't for that nuisance at the end.","reviewtitle":"Great!","reviewer":"CasualListener","reviewdate":"2009-01-23 16:47:27","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"A wonderfully entertaining recording, great fun!","reviewtitle":"Wanted - 7 Fearless Engineers","reviewer":"penthorpe","reviewdate":"2010-01-05 16:56:31","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"The narration was rather fun on this one.

You would have all the comforts you ever dreamed of, but you'd have to leave everything behind.  Would you accept such a challenge?  \n\nEnter seven fearless engineers and their wives who are willing to do just that.  This is such a cute story, short, and ends a bit abruptly, but otherwise I really enjoyed it.  \n\nA special kudos to the reading which was excellent.  The mix of voices was superb and the quality of the recordings likewise was excellent.  Thank you! :-)","reviewtitle":"This was a great story!","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2011-02-14 18:51:31","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Terrific story and terrific readers.
