Read by Gregg Margarite\n\nIn the afterlife grizzled sea captain Eli Stormfield finds himself piloting a ship to heaven. Despite a detour and some navigation errors he arrives but finds the transition to heavenly bliss a little disconcerting. \u2013 Although first drafted in the late 1870\u2019s this story did not see print until the December 1907 and January 1908 issues of \u201cHarper\u2019s Magazine\u201d. The next year it was made available as a Christmas gift book and represents the last volume Mark Twain published in his lifetime.
