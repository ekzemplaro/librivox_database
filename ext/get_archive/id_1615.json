T. Meade and Robert Eustace. \nRead by J. M. Smallheer. \n\n\"That a secret society, based upon the lines of similar institutions so notorious on the Continent during the last century, could ever have existed in the London of our day may seem impossible. Such a society, however, not only did exist, but through the instrumentality of a woman of unparalleled capacity and genius, obtained a firm footing. A century ago the Brotherhood of the Seven Kings was a name hardly whispered without horror and fear in Italy, and now, by the fascinations and influence of one woman, it began to accomplish fresh deeds of unparalleled daring and subtlety in London. By the wide extent of its scientific resources, and the impregnable secrecy of its organisations, it threatened to become a formidable menace to society, as well as a source of serious anxiety to the authorities of the law.\" (excerpt from <i>The Brotherhood of the Seven Kings<\/i>) \n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2008-01-20"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks; mystery; Madame Koluchy"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-01-20 05:18:58"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-01-20 18:55:12","2008-03-27 04:07:07","2011-12-29 00:18:24"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This listener thoroughly enjoyed this tale.  It seemed like it was most likely a serial, as each chapter was a story in it own right.  Very modern in regards that the arch-nemesis of the main character was a beautiful woman who's cunning evil allowed her to fool many of those in the high society of late 19th century London. A fast paced chase, follows the wreckage and death she leave in her wake, as she uses the well-to-do as pawns, in her devious plans to acquire wealth and power.  \n \nThe naivete of turn of  the nineteenth century is apparent by the main character's \"ability\" to read a person's face and determine if they are telling the truth or not, and the poisoning of a character with electricity. Though this does remind one of when the USSR was blasting  a US Consulate with microwave energy during the Cold War...  Refreshing was remembering back to times when a person's word actually meant something!  Quaint were the modes of transportation, the train, the Brougham and the Hansom cab.  \n\nI'm sure this isn't for everyone (I'm 55), but for those of us with a little \"snow on the roof\" and fans of authors like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I think you might enjoy this fast moving tale, too!\n\nMs Smallheer gets 5 stars for an awesome job of her presentation!!!","reviewtitle":"Great fast paced story.  Five star presentation!","reviewer":"gl1200phil","reviewdate":"2010-02-24 04:23:55","stars":"5"}]},
