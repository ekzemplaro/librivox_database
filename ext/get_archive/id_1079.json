He reminds me of Victor Hugo, coming up with endless axioms.\n\nTess of the d'urbervilles is much easier to have sympathy and empathy for.  Bathsheba so far, not at all, and other times empathy for her entanglements.  And respect for such an independent woman.\n\nThere is much charm, colorful and likable characters, compassion and humour in madding crowd tha its given credit for(so far that i have read) \n\nThe novel in part reminds me of the mixed emotions and actions of tv series \"east enders\" but of course in not nearly such a rapid mood and changes of actions.\n\n(only a third way through but my pathological need to comment...sigh. i will try to revise, make concise, etc after finished  reading)","reviewtitle":"Thomas Hardy is a great novelist but","reviewer":"dahszil","reviewdate":"2014-12-06 13:57:43","stars":"4"}]},
