Scottish poet William McGonagall is widely considered to be one of the worst poets of the English language.  He wrote this poem in honor of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tay_Rail_Bridge\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Tay Rail Bridge<\/a> which was opened in 1878 and which subsequently collapsed a year later, causing the death of 75 train passengers, and inspiring McGonagall to write yet famously bad poem entitled <em>The Tay Bridge Disaster<\/em>.  This was the weekly poetry project for the week of March 26, 2006.<br \/>(Summary by Annie Coleman)\n\nFor information about our readers, see our catalog page:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-railway-bridge-of-the-silvery-tay-by-william-mcgonagall\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-railway-bridge-of-the-silvery-tay-by-william-mcgonagall\/<\/a>\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to find out how you can volunteer, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/railway_bridge_of_the_silvery_tay_librivox\/TheRailwayBridgeOfTheSilveryTay_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (12MB)<\/a>"],"publicdate":["2006-04-02 21:44:36"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"creator":["William McGonagall"],"updatedate":["2006-04-02 21:46:41"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140320165745[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020515"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"],"runtime":["26:24"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"]},
