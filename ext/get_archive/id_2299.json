The first chapter relates Dickens' visit to the ancient Richard Watts's Charity at Rochester. The second chapter is the touching story of \"Richard Doubledick\", which Dickens supposedly told the travellers, and Dickens' journey home on Christmas morning provides the short concluding chapter.

Thank you Ruth. More please!\n\nTheBookworm (Manchester, UK)","reviewtitle":"Dickens short stories","reviewer":"TheBookworm","reviewdate":"2008-08-21 14:03:06","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This story's only connection to Christmas is that the main story is set up as a narration told on Christmas eve. The main story itself is a classic Dickens' morality tale, and charming enough if you are a Dickens fan. Ruth Golding, as ever, is a superlative narrator.","reviewtitle":"Dickens at Christmas?","reviewer":"Kydiana","reviewdate":"2009-12-09 21:51:08","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"\"The Seven Poor Travellers\" (1854) is a short Christmas story co-written by Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins. It is based on a real place in England called <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Watts#Six_Poor_Travellers_House\" rel=\"nofollow\">Six Poor Travellers House<\/a> (Dickens is the 7th traveller of the story title). Part 1 is the opening frame story, part 2 is a story-within and part 3 the conclusion of the frame. I can't be sure but it seems Dickens wrote most or all of part 1&3 (the frame) while Collins probably wrote the story of Richard Doubledick (wonderful name). I found part 1&3 to be enchanting and part 2 of little appeal. Ruth Golding gives a professional level reading which adds to the stories atmosphere. If for no other reason than learning about the Six Poor Travellers House part 1&3 are well worth the listen, but if your a poor traveller for time, don't feel too guilty about skipping the main course IMO.","reviewtitle":"\"The Seven Poor Travellers\"","reviewer":"stbalbach","reviewdate":"2010-02-16 04:56:01","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"You may also be interested in journalist Henry Lucy's experiences at Watts's some years after Dickens' visit there.

There are only 3 chapters but the 2nd has practically nothing to do with the 1st and 3rd.  It is a completely seperate story that really wasn't that compeling, just an ordinary short story tale. \n\nI would have skipped this short story entirely had I gone back in time.  Without Dicken's name attached, I doubt this novel would have recieved any significant acclaim or popularity.
