It is a clearly written account of political economy at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, and is widely considered to be the first modern work in the field of economics.

I am amazed at how relevant so much of the work remains in today's world. I would commend Smith to anyone; especially the version read by Stephen Escalera.\n\nAdam Smith does not need praise from me for his history making and world-changing masterpiece. I wrote this review to compliment Mr. Escalera for his outstanding reading of the work. My first Librivox audio books were Sherlock Holmes mysteries. The readers ranged from good to less than good. Mr. Escalera is among the best audio book readers I have encountered and is on a par with professional actors and authors reading their own works. Stephen Ambrose comes to mind.\n\nI would urge anyone with an interest in the Economy to listen to \"The Wealth of Nations\" as read by Mr. Escalera.\n\nDJ","reviewtitle":"The Wealth of Nations Read by Stephen Escalera","reviewer":"DJ_91311","reviewdate":"2011-02-20 06:11:38","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"An excellent read of a fascinating book.
