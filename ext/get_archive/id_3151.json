"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"3.67"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Minor London. In this post-catastrophe novel, a one time professor looks back on the years of world wide plague, which started in 2013 and relates his history to the present day. London's treatment of events is at its best when describing the arrival of the disease and the immediate aftermath. Some prescience here as regards to the emergence of world wide epidemic and the modern spread of deadly viruses. Elsewhere it's less convincing and the relationships between characters are thinly sketched out, indicating a lack of overall conviction or perhaps a commercial imperative for the writing. Interestingly, given his politics, London does not see the collapse into barbarism as necessitating a call to socialism, though there is some cruel levelling. The reader is generally good, although his cadences can be monotonous.","reviewtitle":"Post Catastrophe runs shallow","reviewer":"Arch Stanton","reviewdate":"2010-03-28 14:29:38","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"I love dystopic survival stories, 5 stars from me. If you did not get much enjoyment from grandpa's war stories as a kid, I can see where you might feel there is a lack of action, but I loved it.","reviewtitle":"Very Dystopic, 5 stars!","reviewer":"Pyrodin123321","reviewdate":"2010-06-24 18:53:41","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is a book that left me needing a good dose of Wodehouse when I was done.  \n\nThis is the story of the fall of the human race to a plague known as the Scarlet Plague, and the life that arises from those that survived.  It is sad, unbelievably depressing, and unlike other stories, there is nothing at the end that leaves you with a feeling of hope, only despair.  Eat chocolate when you are done.\n\nThe reader was excellent, and the recordings were great.  The story was just too sad for my liking. \n","reviewtitle":"How sad!","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-10-11 14:09:14","stars":"3"}]},
