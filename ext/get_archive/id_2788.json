Read by Adrian Praetzellis.\n\nThe journal of nature-lover John Muir who spent the summer of 1869 walking California\u2019s Sierra Nevada range. From French Bar to Mono Lake and the Yosemite Valley, Muir was awestruck by everything he saw. The antics of the smallest \u201cinsect people\u201d amazed him as much as stunted thousand-year old Juniper trees growing with inconceivable tenacity from tiny cracks in the stone. Muir spent the rest of his life working to preserve the high Sierra, believing that \u201cthe clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.\u201d John Muir (1838-1914) was born in Dunbar, Scotland and grew up in Wisconsin, USA. This recording commemorates the 140th anniversary of that first summer.
