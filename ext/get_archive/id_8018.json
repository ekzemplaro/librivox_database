This meant bringing the entire ecosystem, the good, the bad and the ugly. Viruses as well as grass, goats as well as stink bugs and allowing the whole mixture to ultimately produce an inhabitable world for humans. But what happens when this system is not properly supervised? Moran and the others in the space yacht Nadine find a world where strange things have been brewing for over a hundred years and may or may not survive an environment gone mad. (Summary by the reader, Phil Chenever) \n\n    For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/planet-of-dread-by-murray-leinster\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nStandard or slim <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/LibrivoxPlainVanillaCdCaseInsertsVolume6\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD Case Insert<\/a> available for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2013-07-18"],"year":["2013"],"subject":["SF; Leinster;science fiction; audiobook;librivox"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140318034047[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020400"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.33"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This story is so far out of the box, you wouldn't see the Sci-Fi box even with a telescope.\n    I've listened to so many Librivox books, you could count them in increments of 100. Plus library books & other sources. This story is sooo so off the wall, very very unpredictable, extremely engaging, etc. etc. etc.\n   If anybody knows any audiobooks even half as good as this, I would sure like to hear about it.\n   And the reader Phil... Hey. Anybody who listens to Librivox stuff already knows Phil's excellence is consistent & top notch, every time, all the time.","reviewtitle":"5 stars x 10","reviewer":"GonzoRanch","reviewdate":"2013-08-21 01:50:57","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"A short novella of a very early type: the monsters on the new world are giant Earth creatures created by a failed terraforming project. Interesting to those who like the tropes of the Rocket Age, but a problematic text in many ways. Why is the female crewman in charge of cleaning the rocket? I was kind of hoping, since she was the love interest, that Crewman Carol was going to turn out to be a Polish man, like the recent Pope also named Carol. Alas, the twist was that even in the future, the love of a good woman, a large sum of money, and a convenient rocket will make any criminal good.\n\n\nOne whole star for Phil's read, which is just excellent.  He completely inhabits the narratorial character.","reviewtitle":"A mediocre book saved by an excellent read, IMO.","reviewer":"Timothy Ferguson","reviewdate":"2013-10-03 02:25:18","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"The hero of this story is an escapee from a planet, and in this age of space travel, you need papers to get anywhere.  He decides the best thing is to conk someone and sneak aboard a departing space ship.  The problem is that for the ship to land, the papers have to match how many members are on board.  The crew, being escapees themselves, decide to abandon him on what appears to be a human-friendly planet.  However, this planet was not quite set up right...  so begins the brief mischief on the Planet of Dread.\n\nI think the story was kind of short.  It would have been fun to explore things a bit more.  It was an okay story tho, good for a sci-fi library.\n\nPhil did his usual excellent reading job.  Thank you Phil!\n","reviewtitle":"This was good","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2013-10-09 20:17:15","stars":"4"}]},
