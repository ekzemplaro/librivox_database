This meant bringing the entire ecosystem, the good, the bad and the ugly. Viruses as well as grass, goats as well as stink bugs and allowing the whole mixture to ultimately produce an inhabitable world for humans. But what happens when this system is not properly supervised? Moran and the others in the space yacht Nadine find a world where strange things have been brewing for over a hundred years and may or may not survive an environment gone mad. (Summary by the reader, Phil Chenever) \n\n    For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/planet-of-dread-by-murray-leinster\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2013-07-18"],"year":["2013"],"subject":["SF; Leinster;science fiction; audiobook;librivox"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"]},

Plus library books & other sources. This story is sooo so off the wall, very very unpredictable, extremely engaging, etc. etc. etc.\n   If anybody knows any audiobooks even half as good as this, I would sure like to hear about it.\n   And the reader Phil... Hey. Anybody who listens to Librivox stuff already knows Phil's excellence is consistent & top notch, every time, all the time.\n","reviewtitle":"5 stars x 10","reviewer":"GonzoRanch","reviewdate":"2013-08-21 01:50:57","stars":"5"}]},
