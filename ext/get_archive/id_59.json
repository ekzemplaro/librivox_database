The book tells the story of \"Huck\" Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer's sidekick in <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer<\/em>), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft.  Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.<br \/><br \/>As Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures.  The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim.  A constant theme throughout the book is Huck's internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn't possibly be wrong to help him.<br \/><br \/><em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<\/em> was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set.  Although the book was originally intended as a sequel to the children's book <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer<\/em>, as Twain wrote <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<\/em> it progressed into a more serious work.  Twain's views on slavery and other social issues of the time become clear through the words, thoughts, and actions of Huck Finn.  The book has always been the subject of great controversy, and according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ala.org\/ala\/oif\/bannedbooksweek\/bbwlinks\/100mostfrequently.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The American Library Association<\/a> it was fifth on the list of most frequently challenged books in the 1990s.<br \/>(Summary by Annie Coleman)\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-by-mark-twain\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks3\/AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (296MB)<\/a>\n\n\n<table cellpadding=\"10\"><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn_2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn_2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"book_title Thumbnail\" \/><\/a><\/td><td><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Huck_Finn.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Huck_Finn_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"book_title Thumbnail\" \/><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn_2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD booklet<\/a><\/span><br \/><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn_2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Album Art<\/a><\/span><\/td><td><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Huck_Finn.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD booklet<\/a><\/span><br \/><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/huck_finn_librivox\/Huck_Finn.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Album Art<\/a><\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table>"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; literature; twain; huckleberry; finn"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-07-30 14:13:38"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","ARossi","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-07-31 00:41:12","2006-07-31 00:53:59","2006-08-01 22:37:05","2006-08-28 03:05:14","2007-03-10 17:07:22","2010-10-12 19:20:15"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140318032332[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020312"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},

Then I began reading a paper copy of Huck Finn--that is the only experience I recommend. Sitting down with your favorite mp3 compatible sound system and a paper copy of Huck Finn is an excellent way to spend any particular part of your day.\n\nAnnie Coleman's voice has accompanied my first reading of Huck Finn through all of the chapters of the book and will stay with me forever--when *ever* I read this book, her's will be the voice I'm listening to in my mind--no other will do.\n\n Thanks Annie!","reviewtitle":"A beautiful introduction to a beautiful classic.","stars":"5","reviewer":"Dominick","reviewdate":"2007-02-05 21:41:05"},{"reviewbody":"this recording really helped me read the book, other wise i probably would have used spark notes which is ok but i still woulnt have read the book. \n\nAnnie does a great job of reading the book, by speaking with the acents and differnt voices for differnt charaters, which made it really enjoyable to listen to.","reviewtitle":"Crazy Good","reviewer":"J Berkes","reviewdate":"2008-02-19 04:54:01","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I didn't want to read the book in the first place, but once I started to listen to the recording, it was great.

I'd stop listening them inute Tom Sawyer shows up.
