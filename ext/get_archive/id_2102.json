Read by Mil Nicholson\n\nCharles Dickens the author of Dombey and Son, originally wrote the book in installments which were published from October 1846 to April 1848 under the title Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son: Wholesale, Retail and for Exportation.\n\nThe story centers around Paul Dombey, the stern owner of the Firm. He is totally immersed in having his newly born son continue the business, and entirely neglects his daughter Florence. Tragedy occurs, and Florence\u2019s plight worsens. As the years go by, Mr. Dombey sees to it that the man she loves, his employee, is sent far away. Mr Dombey remarries, but his marriage is eventually destroyed, his fortune gone, he becomes destitute. Finally he accepts help from his daughter, and life changes for him. Many wonderful characters interweave the tale, as in all Dickens literary masterpieces.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":6,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Is Dombey the zenith of Dickens' talent? \nMaybe. The emotional depth of this novel is profound but it's not overly grim and introspective, for there are weird and wonderful characters here aplenty.  And the ending is redemptive.\n\nWe may assume that Mil Nicholson, the reader,  is a professional actor who is presently ah... resting. Her voice characterisations are flawlessly consistent from beginning to end of this long (but not long enough) novel. \n\nA wonderful recording in the best tradition of LibriVox.  Thank you, Mil, for making my drive to work a pleasure.","reviewtitle":"Fabulous reading!","reviewer":"TheBookworm","reviewdate":"2009-04-07 03:36:57","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Most outstanding reading! Thank you, Mil Nicholson!","reviewtitle":"wonderful!","reviewer":"fistook","reviewdate":"2011-01-04 10:02:54","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Although I love reading Dickens, there is an advantage to hearing his novels read by such an excellent actress as Mil Nicholson.\n\nOn reading Dickens, I have found some of the extended monologues to be tedious. Not being british, I am not well aquainted with British dialects. Mil Nicholson breaths life into these monologues making them thoroughly enjoyable accentuating the idiosyncrasies of the various dialects. It awakes an appetite to replay the monologues a number of times.\n\nNothing needs to be said about the greatness of the novel \"Dombey and Son.\" I do highly recommend this rendition of it. It carried me through a long bout of the flu and was a great consolation.\n\nThank you, Mil Nicholson!","reviewtitle":"Listening to Dickens","reviewer":"RenzoT","reviewdate":"2011-03-26 16:05:14","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Mil Nicholson is a treasure. Thank you for another memorable reading.","reviewtitle":"Thank You Mil Nicholson","reviewer":"sarahm","reviewdate":"2011-09-11 00:15:16","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Thank you to Charles Dickens and Mil Nicholson for this marvelous work of art! I wish I could give them each 10 stars! I've read a LOT of Dickens, and this is certainly my favorite book by far! I wished that it would go on and on, and even though it's already a long book, I would've loved to have more! The metaphoric use of the ocean throughout was beautiful, and twice I actually had to take a short break from the story and read a lighthearted young adult novel in the interim because the emotional depth of Dombey and Son is so great (but without being morbid or overly sentimental) that I needed to step away and grieve along with the characters for their misfortunes. How many books are that realistically emotional and true to life? There is a little piece of my heart that will always belong to Dombey and Son!\n\nMil Nicholson's narration is such a treat that I'm going to find every book she's recorded and listen to it! She must be a professional actress, narrator, or voiceover artist because the narration of this book sounds professionally produced! (Frankly, her narration is light years beyond what I've heard in MANY audiobooks for which I've paid!) She expertly manages unique voices for dozens of quirky characters so masterfully that she brings them to life! Ms. Nicholson is a true gem, and I applaud her talent and am grateful for the time and energy she devotes to reading for LibriVox!\n\nIn sum, LISTEN TO THIS BOOK!","reviewtitle":"I wish I could rate this book higher than five stars!","reviewer":"glttrgrl8","reviewdate":"2014-05-19 23:53:09","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I have re-read Dombey & Son more than any other Dickens work, and now that I have to rely on audiobooks for my access to literature, I am inexpressibly grateful to Mil Nicholson for her version of this extraordinary novel.\n\nShe is indeed a professional, as are a number of other LibriVox readers.  Many non-professional LibriVox readers produce work on the same level of professionalism as Mil.  Forget about the distinction.\n\nHow marvellous to be able to enter the imaginative worlds of so many great writers through the generosity of these people.  Bless you all.","reviewtitle":"Magnificent reading of a pivotal Dickens work","reviewer":"poet-taster","reviewdate":"2014-05-20 12:50:27","stars":"5"}]},
