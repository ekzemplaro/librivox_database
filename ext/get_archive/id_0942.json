"metadata":{"identifier":["pickwickpapers_0709_librivox"],"title":["The Pickwick Papers"],"creator":["Charles Dickens"],"mediatype":["audio"],"description":["The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, better known as The Pickwick Papers, is the first novel by Charles Dickens. Written for publication as a serial, The Pickwick Papers consists of a sequence of loosely-related adventures. Its main literary value and appeal is formed by its numerous unforgettable heroes. Each personage in The Pickwick Papers (just as in many other Dickens' novels) is drawn comically, often with exaggerated features of character.
