Read by Roger Melin.\n\n\"Nello and Patrasche were left all alone in the world.\" So begins the poignant story of the two orphans who were to become inseparable companions. They were Nello, an orphaned youth, and Patrasche, the dog which he and his grandfather saved from near death one day. The tale takes place outside of Antwerp, and so popular has this story become that there is a commemorative statue of Nello and Patrasche standing in the village yet today. The story is powerful, and masterfully written by Marie Louise de la Ram\u00e9e under the pseudonym Ouida.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":2,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"<br \/><i>A Dog of Flanders: A Christmas Story<\/i> is a young adult book written by the Victorian English author Marie Louise de la Ram\u00e9e (aka \"Ouida\"). It's a sentimental animal fable, part of her lifelong campaign to draw attention to the problem of cruelty to dogs. It's set in Flanders where dogs are routinely worked to death. The hero of the story, a peasant boy named Nello, saves an old dog Patrsche from such a fate. When Nello falls impossibly in love outside his class with the millers daughter, Alois, his heart is broken when she is denied to him by her cruel father. Nello and Patrsche then run out into a snowstorm and freeze to death in the Cathedral of Antwerp, on Christmas Eve (thus the \"Christmas Story\"). It is only discovered too late that Nello was a \"genius\" at drawing and could have been famous. \n\nI found the story pleasant and emotionally moving. It can be overly sentimental in that Victorian way, and has some Romantic Nationalism, but the story is good and leaves one with a positive feeling in the end. Although Ouida wrote over 40 novels and was very popular in her time, she is hardly read anymore, this childrens books now appears to be the most popular of her works. But in her time her most famous work was <i>Under Two Flags<\/i> (1867), which was still being published and read in the 20th century, including 4 different movie adaptations. Likewise <i>A Dog of Flanders<\/i> seems to have inspired at least 7 movies, as recently as 1999. It also sells well in Japan.\n\nSee also the book which has a lot of original artwork: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/dogofflanderschr00ouid\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>A Dog of Flanders: A Christmas Story<\/i><\/a>.\n\n----\n\nRoger Melin's LibriVox reading is very good and appropriate for the story, it's at a professional level. My only complaint is I wish Roger would not (try to) raise the pitch of his baritone voice to sound like a woman or little boy when reading dialogue :)\n\n[STB, 12-18-09, 287]","reviewtitle":"A Dog of Flanders","reviewer":"stbalbach","reviewdate":"2009-12-18 14:45:26","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I'm not a literary critic - for me this was simply a lovely children's story about a boy and his dog and the bond of friendship between them.\n\nIt is a solo recording by Roger Melin and very well done.\n\nCaution:  The next review (from stbalbach) contains a spoiler.","reviewtitle":"A beautiful and poignantly sad children's story","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2010-03-01 22:31:29","stars":"5"}]},
