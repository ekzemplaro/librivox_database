Sadly I was disapointed. KSM had been a real adventure, but this story was like a lost forlorn love story with a bit of \"darkest africa\" thrown in.\n\nThe story itself started alright with a mystery, but then wondered off in to boring realms. The characters were well done but the story was just lacking as far as I was concerned.  Not enough happened.\n\nSadly the recording also suffered. The story was read by various people taking various chapters, which is not normally a problem for me, but in this case as the story itself was not so engaging I found myself being jarred by the change in reader, and the readers styles changed dramaticly.  Not a problem with any reader, but because the story was not engaging enough\n\nReading = 1\/3\nProduction = 2\/3\nStory = 1\/3\n\nTotal = 4\/9\n\nMore of my reviews at http:\/\/freeaudioreview.blogspot.com","reviewtitle":"Free Audio, Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2008-05-10 21:27:08","stars":"2"},{"reviewbody":"The novel is fascinating. The end is very moving, and remember that I'm no woman. It's a very engaging story.\n\nHowever, I agree with what the previous reviewer said: the recodings here aren't good. They lack \"character\". The voices aren't \"real\". It's as if they're reading the phone directory!\n\nI was fortunate not to stumble upon the recordings here before I picked up this book. They would have ruined my experience.\n\nBut I *did* listen to recordings, that are available at http:\/\/www.audiobooksforfree.com. They are in extremely poor sound quality (because I didn't pay for a better sound quality), but the reader, Robert Donald, seems to be a very talented reader. I owe him my enjoyment of this novel.","reviewtitle":"She","reviewer":"Albert Schlef","reviewdate":"2008-09-23 16:12:03","stars":"1"},{"reviewbody":"This is a great story, well read at 1rst, most of the end chapters are read by several non english readers, in monotone, poorly pronounced, it is hard to follow who is speaking, or what is being said. As a reader who really enjoys Haggard's stories, this one was painful to finish. His stories contain so many complex phrases that are now hard to follow. Please re-record these chapters for the good of all those who enjoy this series","reviewtitle":"Many Chapters need to be Re-Read Please!!!","reviewer":"Jamoke","reviewdate":"2011-08-12 00:30:36","stars":"1"}]},
