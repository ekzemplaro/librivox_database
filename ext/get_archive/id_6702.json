A Story of Southern Caste Prejudice by Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins. <br \/> Read by LibriVox Volunteers<br \/>\n Hagar's Daughter was first published serially in \"The Colored American Magazine\" in 1901-1902 by Pauline E. Hopkins, a prominent African-American novelist, journalist, historian, and playwright. The book was described as \"a powerful narrative of love and intrigue, founded on events which happened in the exciting times immediately following the assassination of President Lincoln: a story of the Republic in the power of Southern caste prejudice toward the Negro.\" (From the January, 1901, issue of \"The Colored American Magazine\") In another of her works, the author explained the nature and purpose of her literary efforts: \"But, after all, it is the simple, homely tale, unassumingly told, which cements the bond of brotherhood among all classes and all complexions. Fiction is of great value to any people as a preserver of manners and customs\u2014religious, political and social. It is a record of growth and development from generation to generation. No one will do this for us; we must ourselves develop the men and women who will faithfully portray the inmost thoughts and feelings of the Negro with all the fire and romance which lie dormant in our history, and, as yet, unrecognized by writers of the Anglo-Saxon race.\" (From the Preface, Contending Forces, 1900) (Summary by lubee930) <br \/>\n For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/hagars-daughter-by-pauline-elizabeth-hopkins\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.<br \/><br \/> For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks_11\/hagarsdaughter_1402.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (235MB)<\/a>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"mediatype":["audio"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks;slavery; abolition; racism; emancipation"],"title":["Hagar's Daughter.

It makes for a fun listen. Because the author rather too obviously stacks the deck, it's too easy to guess the mystery at the core of the book, but that really is not a problem.\n\nThe problem here is the ending, and the plot contrivances used to get to that ending. That end does fit the general theme of the book, but requires a number of characters to act vigorously against their best interests.\n\nThe readers do a good job on this story.
