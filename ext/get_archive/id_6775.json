Although young, wealthy, and of high social position, he is nevertheless an indefatigable worker in his chosen field. He smiles when men call him a detective. \"No; only an investigator,\" he says.\nHe has never courted notoriety; indeed, his life has been more or less secluded. However, let a man do remarkable work in any line and, as Emerson has observed, \"the world will make a beaten path to his door.\"\nThose who have found their way to Ashton-Kirk's door have been of many races and interests. Men of science have often been surprised to find him in touch with the latest discoveries, scholars searching among strange tongues and dialects, and others deep in tattered scrolls, ancient tablets and forgotten books have been his frequent visitors. But among them come many who seek his help in solving problems in crime.\n\"I'm more curious than some other fellows, that's all,\" is the way he accounts for himself. \"If a puzzle is put in front of me I can't rest till I know the answer.\" At any rate his natural bent has always been to make plain the mysterious; each well hidden step in the perpetration of a crime has always been for him an exciting lure; and to follow a thread, snarled by circumstances or by another intelligence has been, he admits, his chief delight.\nThere are many strange things to be written of this remarkable man--but this, the case of the numismatist Hume, has been selected as the first because it is one of the simplest, and yet clearly illustrates Ashton-Kirk's peculiar talents. It will also throw some light on the question, often asked, as to how his cases come to him. (Summary by John T. McIntyre) \nNarrated by Pete Milan\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/ashton-kirk-investigator-by-john-thomas-mcintyre\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org <\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-09-04"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["Detective; Mystery; Investigator; Murder; New York; Librivox;audio"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"]},
