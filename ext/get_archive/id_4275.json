Dick. Read by Gregg Margarite.\n\nPredictability has come a long way. The computers of the future can tell you if you\u2019re going to win a war before you fire a shot. Unfortunately they\u2019re predicting perpetual standoff between the Terran and Centaurian Empires. What they need is something unpredictable, what they get is Thomas Cole, a man from the past accidently dragged forward in time. Will he fit their calculations, or is he the random variable that can break the stalemate? \u2013 The Variable Man first appeared in the September, 1953 issue of Space Science Fiction magazine.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":2,"avg_rating":"4.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"John Cole is the variable man from the past who is brought by accident to the future.  It's a good thing too, because without him, the Terrans really can't fix Icarus, the bomb destined to free the Terrans from Centarian blockade.  \n\nAh, but what would a story be without an antagonist?  Enter Reinhart, the shoot-em-first-and-ask-questions-later general who doesn't like variables in his war calculations.  In fact, he prefers dead variables.  \n\nI have to say, for a short story, this one really kept me listening.  It was great!  The reader is also great; I enjoy his style of reading.  Enjoy!","reviewtitle":"Such a cool story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-05-12 21:10:17","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"The story is great but unlike the other reviewer, I found the reading to be extremely difficult to endure.  At first, I thought it was a computer or some sort of software doing the reading.  It is monotone and every word is...spaced... out...like and exaggerated Capt. Kirk impression.  Very unnatural.  If you can put up with that, you'll enjoy the brilliance of Philip K. Dick who was so far ahead of his time.","reviewtitle":"Story Good \/Reading Awful","reviewer":"BeanieandCecil","reviewdate":"2012-07-19 16:28:16","stars":"3"}]},
