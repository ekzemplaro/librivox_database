Law revolutionized the way in which 18th century Anglicans engaged the spiritual aspect of their faith, and his popularity rivaled that of John and Charles Wesley. Law adapted mystical practices from early church writings to the practice and doctrine of the modern British church, with the intention of equipping the Anglican layman to pursue intimacy with Christ.\n\nA Dialogue Between a Methodist and a Churchman is one of Law\u2019s purely theological works. In it, Law engages what he sees as the most dangerous doctrines of Methodism using a dialectic format. The dialogue focuses especially on the Calvinistic doctrines of predestination and absolute depravity, and is remarkable for its extrapolation of Calvinist proof texts to refute the doctrines they allegedly prove.\n\n(Summary by Kirsten Ferreri)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/dialogue-between-a-methodist-and-a-churchman-by-william-law\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks5\/DialogueBetweenAMethodistAndAChurchman.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (43MB)<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; non-fiction; religion"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-04-01 18:08:20"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-04-09 19:02:05","2012-01-04 11:09:45"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140313031518[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020515"],"runtime":["1:34:26"]},
