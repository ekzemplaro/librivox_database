This book has it all: excitement, sentiment, destruction of private property (plenty of that), paganism, and a happy ending. The prose is beautiful and occasionally requires the use of a dictionary - I had to look up \u201casperities.\u201d Written as a children\u2019s story, The Wind in the Willows is enjoyed by many grown-ups who relish Grahame\u2019s ability to evoke the long summer days of childhood.
