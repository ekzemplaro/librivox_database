Marshall began writing the Principles of Economics in 1881 and he spent much of the next decade at work on the treatise. His plan for the work gradually extended to a two-volume compilation on the whole of economic thought; the first volume was published in 1890 to worldwide acclaim that established him as one of the leading economists of his time. It brought the ideas of supply and demand, of marginal utility and of the costs of production into a coherent whole, and became the dominant economic textbook in England for a long period. The second volume, which was to address foreign trade, money, trade fluctuations, taxation, and collectivism, was never published at all. (Wikipedia) \n\nThis first introductory book gives the author's overview of the field of economics. The recording is based on the eight edition, published in 1920.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/principles-of-economics-book-1-by-alfred-marshall\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2007-11-06"],"year":["2007"],"subject":["economics; librivox; audiobook"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-11-06 23:26:49"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2007-11-06 23:30:35","2007-11-06 23:47:28","2011-12-17 08:44:24"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
