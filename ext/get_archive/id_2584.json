The book is set during the Babylonian Captivity, a period when Jews were deported and exiled to Babylon following the Siege of Jerusalem of 597 BC. The book revolves around the figure of Daniel, an Israelite who becomes an adviser to Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon from 605 BC - 562 BC. The book has two distinct parts: a series of six narratives (chapters one to six) and four apocalyptic visions (chapters seven to twelve). The narratives take the form of court stories which focus on tests of religious fidelity involving Daniel and his friends (chapters one, three and six), and Daniel\u2019s interpretation of royal dreams and visions (chapters two, four and five). In the second part of the book, Daniel recounts his reception of dreams, visions and angelic interpretations in the first person.\n(Summary by Wikipedia)\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks3\/ASVDaniel.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (33MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2008-10-13"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; Bible; American Standard Version; Old TEstament; Tanakh; Ketuvim; Daniel; religion; prophecy"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-10-12 22:06:15"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-10-13 04:47:18","2011-10-15 09:49:06"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311092840[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020012"]},

Many false teachers exist in USA, but the reports of their activity, fase teachings, and unbiblical theology do not receive much publicity outside of the USA. By the time that others find out, many lives are ruined. In order to avoid this, it is recommended that you study the issues, doctrines, and teachings of many ministries, and compare them to traditional historic orthodox genuine Christianity.

Those unfortunate reworked mistranlated (with deliberate changes and omissions \u2013 as the evidence shows \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid, God did preserve His written Word) false greek versions now affect 95% of Christianity every single day. Its a sad truth that these manuscripts [Vaticanus \u2013 Sinaiticus] are now used for the mistranslation of almost all modern versions in almost All languages. This changeover of using these manuscripts did not take place until 1904. For thousands of years before, <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/TextusReceptusscrivener1860\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this<\/a> was the standard historic ancient greek text used By Churches and Christians all around the world. 99% of the ancient Greek manuscripts support the traditional Historic <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/TextusReceptusscrivener1860\" rel=\"nofollow\">[ ancient Koine Greek New Testament ]<\/a>.. The MANY changes introduced into modern versions of the Bible by Vaticanus and Sinaiticus number more than 5000, some more obvious than others. But Vaticanus and Sinaiticus still contradict the other 99% of the historicmanuscripts written in ancient Greek, which have been found over the centuries.  \n\nBut even more, [in addition to contradicting 99% of the rest of the Bible manuscripts in ancient Greek], Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus do contradict  even EACH other, in moreThan 2000 places. The evidence is there for you to see and read. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/holybiblefacsimi00polluoft\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 1611 KJV <\/a>. , The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/GenevaBible-GenewaBiblii-GenfBibel-GinebraBiblia\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Geneva Bible  <\/a>.  and other early translations are by far the more accurate. Some have noted that in many cases, the modern   -  m-o-d-e-r-n versions [ even in the foreign languages] now take the spiritual power OUT of the Bible. If  IF - they were not translating the Word of God <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/cu31924029275174\" rel=\"nofollow\"> accurately <\/a>., that would not be a surprise.  The Nestle-Aland [ to this day,still founded on the invented text of Westcott and Hort ], used to train seminary students, ( which means future and new pastors) very much uses Codex Vaticanus and Sinaiticus.

Some people think that if they figure out to stay ignorant that they wil not be responsible for that information. Who told you that ? That is not true.

God only is to them the fountain of authority. They profess a willingness to submit to Him, and to submit at any cost. This is the normal principle of Karaism.  They state that they pay unbounded reverence to the Written Law of God, contained in the Old Testament. They utterly reject what is called the Oral Law, and is now contained in the Talmud.  This is an interesting contrast to what passes for traditional Orthodox Judaism, which is very different from simply following the Old testament. This is not what orthodox Judaism is these days.\n\nToday it has degenerated mostly into occult talmudic Judaism with the constant study of the Talmudic occultism [ which seems to have a rather close resemblance to much material found in The Two Babylons by Hislop] .  In the same way that those in Islam should compare the characteristics of Allah with those of Almighty God, those who are Othodox talmudic occultic Rabbis should be willing to compare their worship of their \u201cFirst Cause\u201d with the God of the Old Testament. \n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/historyofkaraite00rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">[ History of the Karaite Jews (1870)]<\/a>.\n\nBy Edersheim (Oxford): \n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lifetimesofjesus01eder\" rel=\"nofollow\">[ The life and times of Jesus the Messiah (1886) 01)  ]<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lifetimesofjesus02eder\" rel=\"nofollow\">[ The life and times of Jesus the Messiah (1886) 02)  ]<\/a>.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/christianincom00gurn\" rel=\"nofollow\">resources<\/a>. here.

We are each responsible<a href=\"http:\/\/www.assistnews.net\/STORIES\/2012\/s12090148.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">for<\/a>. our own spiritual path, and the information and learning we chose to epose ourselves to, or deny or ignore or postpone. Like everything else, your spiritual connection and walk with God is what You make of it. The Bible is filled with information. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/lollardbibleothe00deanuoft\" rel=\"nofollow\">[ not disclosed or talked about in Churches]<\/a>..You have to read the New Testament for yourself. [ the Gospel of John is a good place to start, and remember to use a good, histori and accurate version. It is not what you \u201ctheoretically\u201d want to do, or wish to do, that counts.  If you are deceived spiritually, what difference will it make, that you \u201cwere going to study\u201d or you were \u201c going to learn\u201d ?  Will you be... any less deceived, because you were going to [in the future] actually invest the time in yourself to learn ???\n\nTake the time and learn n-o-w, while you can.\n\nDo you remember the words of scripture : \n\nII Timothy 2: 15  Study  [ STUDY !!! ]  to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly [RIGHTLY] dividing the word of truth.\n16  But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.\n\n\nII Timothy 2:19  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\n20  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.\n21  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.\n22  Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.\n\n\nIts what you actually [ ACTUALLY !!! ]  do, what you actually[ ACTUALLY !!! ]   study. Stop waiting for others to help you, and start helping yourself. The day will soon come when none of this may be around, and then all you will have is what you know, in your head, in your own mind. \n\nPray for yourself that you will wake up from your coma, that you would have a love of God, a love of His true and authentic Word (Bible), a deep desire to study the Word, and that God would show you how to have the spiritual and personal inner strength for these times. Pray that you would not waste your time, but that you would value and do what God wants you to do and <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lexrexorlawprinc00ruth\" rel=\"nofollow\">value<\/a>., and that HE would help you find the answers you are looking for.\n\n\nWhat people MUST believe about God, in order to find Him and why Faith in God is neccessary  -------\uf0e0 Hebrews 11: 6  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.\n\nTo restate the obvious: \nYOU =   \u201c he that cometh to God \u201c\nMUST BELIEVE: \n1) that he is, [ That God exists] ,   and \n2) that he is a rewarder of them that diligently [ DILIGENTLY !!!  ] seek him.\n\n\n\n\nLuke 21: 8 \n8  And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.\n\nII Thess 2\n10  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness ... because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.\n\n( what did they receive not ? This means that there is something that certain ones chose not to receive. What is that ?? ) \n\n----\n\nExample: what they often don\u2019t talk about in church:\n\nTitus 2: 1 \n2:1  But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:\n2  That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.\n3  The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;\n4  That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,\n5  To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.\n6  Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.\n7  In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,\n8  Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.\n9  Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;\n10  Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.\n11  For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,\n12  Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;\n13  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\n\n\n-----\n\nObviously, the links will only take you to the pages for the Free PDF.
