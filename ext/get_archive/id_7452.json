I have listened to it twice in a quest to discover new authors and books for my listening pleasure. \n\nThe opening years of the Twentieth Century certainly produced a diverse selection of American women authors. While Edna Ferber related the challenges of ordinary working women, Edith Wharton... I don't know what to say about her books. They don't make me laugh or cry. They seem as un-living as portraits, portraits the hold your attention. \n\nMary Roberts Rinehart and Anna Katharine Green entertained with memorable mysteries. They could make me smile. Frances Hodgson Burnett, Gene Stratton-Porter, Eleanor H. Porter and Kate Douglas Wiggin gave the world memorable young characters. As a child, The Secret Garden and Little Princess were my absolute favorite books. I love them still and cannot read either with a tear or two. I have rarely been to Indiana, but have fallen in love with Stratton-Porter's Limberlost.\n\nThese are the authors I knew best before listening to this book. Many of their novels are available for download. I am grateful for these author sketches. They introduced me to many more authors whose books I desire to read.
