Read by Tadhg.\n\nThe story is told almost entirely from the point of view of the first person narrator, David Copperfield himself, and was the first Dickens novel to be written as such a narration.The story deals with the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity.David's father had died six months before he was born, and seven years later, his mother remarries but David and his step-father don\u2019t get on and he is sent to boarding school.As Divid settles into life we are taken along with him and meet a dazzling array of characters,some of whom we will never forget and some of whom we won't want to remember!

No doubt of it!\n\nLibriVoxateer Tadhg Hynes does a brilliant job with what the author described as his favourite novel. And what a marathon project it must have been to record this looonnnggg book.

But I was sorry when the final chapter came around.\n\nMany thanks to Tadhg for making this generous contribution to posterity.\n\nTheBookworm (Manchester, UK)","reviewtitle":"David Copperfield","reviewer":"TheBookworm","reviewdate":"2011-07-02 17:35:56","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"What a perfect reading! I find it hard to listen to Dickens if not read with an English accent but this reading definitely hit the right tone. You get the feeling that although it is a long book, it must have been a labour of love for the reader -  there is so much care and humour in the reading. \nDownload it and enjoy!\nThank you Tadhg.","reviewtitle":"David Copperfield","reviewer":"lillipilli","reviewdate":"2011-08-09 02:33:29","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Thanks very much for such an unremitting toil!","reviewtitle":"...","reviewer":"Tamara)","reviewdate":"2011-10-07 15:46:12","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"is now, in my brain, Tadhg's Copperfield.
