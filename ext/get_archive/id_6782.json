I can't guarantee if I will be able to get to this as quick as I'd like to as a listener but am thinking about trying to listen to it as soon as I can though.\n\nThis is just an update: I've gotten through the first book and as now trying the second one. The Iliad of Homer it isn't as easy to follow as I thought it would be for me. I get the feeling I'd do better with it if I had been learning about ancient Greece and if it was read by a full cast of differing reader voices. I might set up a short playlist of the first 3 or 4 books and repeat the playback of the playlist a couple of times before I go further into this piece of historical literature.\n\nGenerally speaking I think Michael Armenta has a pretty good vocal sound when he reads.","reviewtitle":"The Iliad of Homer, Rendered into English Blank Verse","reviewer":"BenjaminS.T.","reviewdate":"2014-04-27 02:18:52"}]},
