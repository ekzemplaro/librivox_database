Unfortunately for Detective Flexen, who is to investigate the case, Lord Loudwater was not a very agreeable sort of fellow and almost every person in his vicinity had a motive for the crime.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Mr Loudwater is a bully who took pleasure in hurting everyone under his control, including his wife, his servants, and even his 'friends', such as they were.  One evening, Loudwater is found stabbed to death in his study.  The detective in charge would like to find the murderer and bring him or her to justice, but there are just so many suspects, and they really don't care since life is better without Loudwater.  \n\nI think I liked this story, but honestly I am not entirely sure.  The ambivalence I feel is because the murder seems to be equally evil and just hides it well, using the victim's wickedness as an excuse to commit a murder.  At first I felt like justice was served possibly in self defense, but as I progressed in the story, I found that I felt the murder should pay for their crime.  \n\nMost of the chapters are very well read, and the recordings are excellent, but I seem to recall one or two were a bit hard to follow.  Overall it is still pretty good, worth a listen.","reviewtitle":"Interesting mystery","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2011-12-08 14:51:28","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Well there were two things wrong with this story.  One the last chapter just sort of let me going, \"huh\".  It did not seem to really tie up all the loose ends.  The rest of the story was rather good though.  Also, if you are a cat lover like I am, nothing bad happens to the cat.  I hate when stories have bad things happen to animals so this one is safe.  The murdered man is not even remotely likeable and I hated him just for trying to kick the cat.  It certainly makes it hard to sympathize with the victim when he is so horrible.  The other issue with this story was the narration.  I wish Richard Kilmer had narrated the whole story.  The other narrators were okay but some where hard to understand.  They did a good job though but Richard Kilmer is just a better narrator.  The story is entertaining though so I would recommend it.","reviewtitle":"Could have been a 5 but....","reviewer":"benefitsingers","reviewdate":"2012-02-06 14:26:10","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"The other reviews are right in that this is an unusual story.  The murder really leads only to benefits for everyone concerned with two exceptions - neither of which deserve much credit to begin with.  The ending is very unusual but perhaps more satisfying than a run-of-the-mill one.\n\nThe readers are all good and while two speak with other than American accents they still read perfectly clearly and well.\n\nA shame the cat disappears from the story too soon - for a moment there I thought he was a suspect!
