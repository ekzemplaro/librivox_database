Marrying for love against the wishes of his influential father-in-law; Donne's career was cast into shadow: forcing him to support his wife, Anne, as best he might under a specter of unforgiving penury. \n\nDespite such hardships - perhaps because of them - Donne's writings demonstrate a mastery of poetry layered with metaphysical meaning and mystery: which continues to delight and challenge modern-day readers. Donne's \"divine poems\" - the focus of this collection - present profound theological insights using absorbing allegories and beautiful imagery. \n\nAt the end of Donne's life - as his health deteriorated under illnesses of increasing severity - his poetry served him as: distraction, consolation, and even \"public confession\". With them, Donne cheerfully but soberly faces the limits of his own mortality: and contemplates the mysteries that lie beyond the grave.\n\n(Introduction by Godsend)\n\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2010-04-18"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; poetry; religion; John Donne; Selection of Divine Poems; Holy Sonnets; Divine Meditations; Divine Sonnets; La Corona; Cross; Litany; Resurrection"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-04-17 22:22:04"],"addeddate":["2010-04-17 22:15:09"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-04-18 16:41:28","2010-04-18 16:51:38","2010-04-18 17:56:59"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
