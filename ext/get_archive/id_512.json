Her purpose was to discover what life was like for those who had been deemed insane. She was surprised to discover the depth of mistreatement of the patients. Partially as a result of her reporting, more money was allocated to the asylum and reforms were put into place.\n\nMy Review\n\nAs the blurb has told you, this is not fiction. It is presented as an extended essay ( book length ). The style in which it is written is captivating and the expose side of it makes it more alluring to the ear.\n\nThe discoveries made by Nellie are staggering and horrorific. Hard to believe that we were so ignorant in the past, but here is the truth its distasteful harsh glare.\n\nThe reader, a young lady herself, seems perfect for the reading. She comes over as a forceful and determined lady and fits the character of Nellie perfectly.\n\nReading = 3\/3\nProduction = 2\/3\nStory = 2\/3\n\nmore of my review can be found at http:\/\/freeaudioreview.blogspot.com\/","reviewtitle":"FNH Appraisal","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2008-04-04 18:42:40","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This was an interesting story and the narration was very good.
