Her purpose was to discover what life was like for those who had been deemed insane. She was surprised to discover the depth of mistreatement of the patients. Partially as a result of her reporting, more money was allocated to the asylum and reforms were put into place.\n\nMy Review\n\nAs the blurb has told you, this is not fiction. It is presented as an extended essay ( book length ). The style in which it is written is captivating and the expose side of it makes it more alluring to the ear.\n\nThe discoveries made by Nellie are staggering and horrorific. Hard to believe that we were so ignorant in the past, but here is the truth its distasteful harsh glare.\n\nThe reader, a young lady herself, seems perfect for the reading. She comes over as a forceful and determined lady and fits the character of Nellie perfectly.\n\nReading = 3\/3\nProduction = 2\/3\nStory = 2\/3\n\nmore of my review can be found at http:\/\/freeaudioreview.blogspot.com\/","reviewtitle":"FNH Appraisal","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2008-04-04 18:42:40","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This was an interesting story and the narration was very good.

Her expose of the brutal treatment of the inmates was published in the NY Daily World and led to reforms.\n\nThe following year, 1888, she made an around the world journey in imitation of Jules Verne's Around The World In 80 Days, and she published this in a book called *Around the World in Seventy-Two Days* (of which an excellent reading is here on Librivox).\n\nNellie Bly (t\/n Elizabeth Jane Cochrane)was an extraordinary person, and beautiful too.  More about her here:\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nellie_Bly\n\nThe reader of this book is also terrific, Alys AtteWater - and why are some of the very best readers shy about giving their names!?\n\n","reviewtitle":"Shocking true story by the amazing and intrepid Nellie Bly!","reviewer":"lanternland","reviewdate":"2013-12-10 16:09:19","stars":"5"}]},
