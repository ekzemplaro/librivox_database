The story is set in the English city of Manchester during the 1830s and 1840s and deals heavily with the difficulties faced by the Victorian lower class.\n\nThe novel begins in Manchester, where we are introduced to the Bartons and the Wilsons, two working class families. John Barton reveals himself to be a great questioner of the distribution of wealth and the relation between the rich and the poor. He also relates how his sister-in-law Esther has disappeared after she ran away from home.\n\nSoon afterwards Mrs Barton dies, and John is left with his daughter Mary to cope in the harsh world around them. Having already been deeply affected by the loss of his son Tom at a young age, after the death of his wife, Barton tackles depression and begins to involve himself in the Chartist movement connected with the trade unions.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mary_Barton\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/mary-barton-by-elizabeth-cleghorn-gaskell\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1a\/MaryBartonPart1.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B Part 1 (177MB)<\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1a\/MaryBartonPart2.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B Part 2 (144MB)<\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1a\/MaryBartonPart3.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B Part 3 (115MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2008-10-28"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["mary; barton; gaskell; fiction; librivox; audio books;"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-10-27 06:52:27"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-10-28 22:29:04","2012-02-22 02:08:11"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311084733[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020205"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.50"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"The book is not Gaskell's best, but it is engaging and takes on some interesting issues (labor relations, chartism, prostitution, addiction, poverty, crime and the judicial system).  Plus, the second half in particular is driven by a somewhat predictable but definitely exciting plot.  The reading of the first chapter is terrible, but once you get past that chapter, that reader does not reappear, so bear through the first chapter (or better yet, just read the first chapter), and the readers are at least acceptable--some are even very good--from that point on.","reviewtitle":"Good if you get past the first chapter","reviewer":"Ragereader","reviewdate":"2014-04-14 17:08:14","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Your criticism of the first reader is petty and trivial.  You know all the readers do this for free. And their unselfish work is provided free to all of us.  If you don't like the readers than go and buy the chapters whose readers you dislike and seemingly with quite amount of malice. Lucy Burgoyne is a good mature UK reader.  Her accent, dialect and tone I find charming.  I listen to community radio stations who have internet across the British Isles.  England by itself still has many dialects or accents.  Here in the US our speech has become almost homogenized.  Its either southern or mid atlantic states.  the only exceptions would be older new yorkers and boston.  Oh yes there is a small area in lower western New York State, Olean NY area.  It is interesting, it is sort of a mixture of old NYC accent combined with southern, imho.\n\nI think a decent person restricts their criticisms to the author,writing style, characters, that sort of thing.  I must confess i once or twice to criticize readers before i thought about what these wonderful volunteers do.\nTechnical problems i thought was something to have a critique about.  But librivox and IA are far from being adequately funded.  Perhaps we should donate to some readers a better microphone or whatever.  I do know a directional mic is better than the usual omnidirectional mic.  But I am sure most readers are in economic difficulty like most of us under this globalized, rich get richer, poor get poorer type of capitalism.  And this book reminds me that we today are being driven back to the huge wealth inequality of  Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell's and Dicken's time.\n\nchapter 15: the allusion of uneducated working men in anger as becoming heartless like the monster that Dr.Frankenstein created.  No, on the contrary Glaskell is wrong here.  It was Dr.Frankenstein who was heartless, cruel(and cowardly). It was the world at that time, who confused beauty for goodness and thus the cruelty and homicidal fury against the monster with a \"good heart\" who like an abused child, becomes a violent abuser itself.  This is analogous to the cruel rich and corrupted politicians who are responsible for their cruel treatment and exploitation of poor and workers, which naturally leads to the workers malice towards their cruel and selfish oppressors and exploiters.\n\nHistory has shown us, for all of the DIcken's style writers compassion, change and charity do little for a workers better quality of life and getting their fair share of their labors.  No it was the workers struggles of the late 19th and early 20th century that gave them, and boosted the middle class, a better quality of life, not from the masters of industry and commerce.\n\nEven famous reform leaders of the mid 20th century like Franklin Delano Roosevelt in America and William Beveridge in Great Britain were driven by the millions in organized labour and the progressive middle class. Progressive Social reform is always led from the grass roots, from the bottom of the ediface.  If somehow there were never workers or any other type of progressive movements like ecology, Today children would still be working 12 hour shifts in factories and the world's ecology mostly a thing of the past right here in the \"west\". Since Reagan and Thatcher we the people are getting pushed backed to Dicken's epoch.\n\nToday the struggle is that over production and consumption is so damaging our climate that mankind(gender neutral)may become extinct before this century is over. \n\nupadate: of course this is fiction, but i really wonder if people expressed their emotions so freely in the 19th century?  And even more so the keeping in of emotion.  Could it be that Gaskell and others of her genre are magnifying reality? although i must say that in our day where people in general seem like automatons only expressing quite crude emotions and only just a few types:anger, an aggressive manic type of laughing or just casual aplomb.  i think we today should express more variations of emotions especially tender kindness and letting our tears flow more often.  anger in relatively decent people is an outlet for pain which should be replaced by tears and crying for relief.\n\ndahszil\nmale\nusa","reviewtitle":"@ Ragereader","reviewer":"dahszil","reviewdate":"2014-10-11 12:31:12","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Thanks for defending readers, but please quit lecturing reviewers when they post about a bad reader.
