Read by Timothy Ferguson.\n\nArnold Bennett describes a method for enjoying literature, and suggests the contents of a comprehensive library. Chapters 1-10 and 14 describe his method for learning to enjoy literature. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 contain detailed lists of the 337 volumes required to complete a comprehensive library of English works. This reading is from the 1913 version at Project Gutenberg, and so does not contain the revisions made by Swinnerton for the 1939 edition, which included authors of the early Twentieth Century. Swinnerton's revisions are available from Wikipedia.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":4,"avg_rating":"4.75"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This book was put on our book club list and so I listened to it out of duty, not expecting much at all.  I was amazed and very, very pleased. The author of this book has a facility with English that made me smile many, many times.  His insights on the entire 'literary' world were enlightening and very encouraging to someone like me, who really does need some taste! This book will be listened to by me again very soon.  Really, try it. It is great and I've listened to 1250+ books in the past 14  years so I am not easily impressed.","reviewtitle":"An Excellent book","reviewer":"philchenevert","reviewdate":"2011-04-09 03:18:51","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Few books spur me to action, but this has done it.  Bennett's chapter on verse begins:\n\n\"There is a word, a \"name of fear,\" which rouses terror in the heart of the vast educated majority of the English-speaking race. The most valiant will fly at the mere utterance of that word. The most broad-minded will put their backs up against it. The most rash will not dare to affront it. I myself have seen it empty buildings that had been full; and I know that it will scatter a crowd more quickly than a hose-pipe, hornets, or the rumour of plague. Even to murmur it is to incur solitude, probably disdain, and possibly starvation, as historical examples show. That word is 'poetry.'\"\n\nTimothy Ferguson does an excellent job of reading the entire book, but after his alternately humorous and chiding reading of this chapter, I have embarked to take the cure and downloaded William Hazlitt's essay \"On Poetry in General\" to get me started on a path to reading (and enjoying) poetry without fear.\n\nI second Phil and highly recommend this book.  Whether you want to read more, or have read much, Bennett will get you thinking about why and what you read and, should you take his suggestions to heart, will invariably help you to become a better reader.","reviewtitle":"Great Book","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2011-07-26 14:08:33","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is a little gem. \n\nWritten by the talented Midlands-born author of Anna of the Five Towns, the Clayhanger trilogy, etc., this piece is witty and down to earth.  There's nothing highfalutin or obscure here, just an honest love of literature.\n\nBennett insists that deriving pleasure from their beautiful language is not the real benefit of reading \"classics\" (which term he defines). Neither is reading literature is merely \"a pleasant pastime and nothing else.\"  Rather its purpose is to \"inform and transform your existence.\" \n\nI cannot praise the reader, Timothy Ferguson, too highly. His gentle Australian accent and subtle phrasing are perfect for this piece.  And sometimes he even breaks into a titter over Bennett's clever prose! \n\nTheBookworm (Manchester, UK)","reviewtitle":"Don't be put off by the title","reviewer":"TheBookworm","reviewdate":"2011-10-11 02:30:32","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Most readers consume what is most easily found. That is how readers become addicted to low-grade literature. A book like this from the past is a welcome sight to see, then. It is especially welcome because no book more modern than the year in which this one was written (1913) can be recommended in it. Mr. Bennett cautions against supposing that no modern book will compare with a classic. But he names \u2018no living author\u2019 in his extensive list of what one should read in the formation of literary taste. He must have been aware of the decline literature was in even by his day. \n\nIn the formation of literary taste, one should begin with the classics. Then there will be less chance of being hoodwinked by mediocrity. Timely advice, this, for almost every reader is hoodwinked by some form of \u2018literary\u2019 mediocrity today. If one were to read Charles Dickens first, would one be able to endure, after that, the mediocre writings of Carol Shields, for instance? Mr. Bennett goes so far as to advise the \u2018eschewing\u2019 of modern literature until literary taste is formed. \u2018Eschew\u2019 is a severe verb. Let reviewers read the worthless books, he counsels. As for you, get a hold of literature, and get on with it! He sermonizes just like that\u2014without apology. I, for one, appreciate his fearless preaching manner. Your typical pastor has not one-half his backbone. \n\nPersons already awake to the wisdom of such talk will be comforted and strengthened by the solidarity. No amount of clatter will convince such people that a tedious book is good. They have faith in their judgment, Bennett knowingly asserts. \u201cThey do not enjoy today what will seem tedious to them tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe most important chapter is called, Broad Counsels. If the advice that is given there were taken by every reader, the world would change noticeably for the better. Demand honesty from an author, but do not forget to be honest yourself, Bennett warns. A book that causes anger is probably a good one. After you have thrown a book down, listen for that whisper, \u2018It\u2019s true, though.\u2019 The reader is urged to yield to that whisper, regardless of whether the truth he is being asked to receive is unpleasant. \u201cA true book is not always great; but a great book is never untrue.\u201d If a novel is true to actual experience, accept it. If an essay says it like it is, accept that. This is what Bennett is talking about.\n\nI cannot approve of some of the books that Bennett recommends. This is why my star count amounts to just four. While I would not say that Literary Taste is a \u2018must-read,\u2019 I will say that it is a \u2018should-read.\u2019 This reading is made easy through the audio medium, and Timothy Ferguson, the excellent orator.\n","reviewtitle":"Admirable Literary Redirection","reviewer":"gaboora","reviewdate":"2013-03-01 18:51:41","stars":"4"}]},
