Translated by T. Bailey Saunders. Read by Carl Manchester.\n\nThe Art of Controversy (or The Art of Being Right) (Die Kunst, Recht zu Behalten) is a short treatise written in 1831 by the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in which he presents thirty-eight methods of gaining an unfair advantage in a debate and thereby being right even if you are wrong. Schopenhauer champions the virtue of dialectical argument, in his view wrongly neglected by philosophers in favour of logic, and goes on to discuss the distinction between our conscious intellectual powers and our will. The text is a favourite of debaters including the philosophers AC Grayling and Mary Warnock, and the Mayor of London Boris Johnson. (Summary by Carl Manchester)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-art-of-controversy-or-the-art-of-being-right-by-arthur-schopenhauer\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"subject":["debate; argument; philosophy; librivox; audiobook; schopenhauer"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-11-05 16:00:53"],"addeddate":["2010-11-05 15:44:00"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-11-05 16:14:39","2010-11-05 16:36:56","2010-11-05 17:07:03"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
