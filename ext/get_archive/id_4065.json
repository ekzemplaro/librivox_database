Read by Nathan\n\nThis poem tells a story that begins in 1823 - just after the Leavenworth campaign against the Arikara Indians - and follows an expedition of Major Andrew Henry during a series of arduous journeys over the Trans-Missouri region.\n\nThe poem describes the friendship that springs up between two trappers - an older man named Hugh Glass, and a younger named Jamie - who fight, scout and hunt together in the wilds. The story is set when Jamie and a companion betray Hugh: Hugh is abandoned - alive, and badly wounded - to die by the Missouri; to allow Jamie and his companion to safely flee the enmity of hostile Indians in the vicinity. Jamie and his fellow cover their cowardice with a specious lie: that they left only after Hugh died of natural causes, whereupon they first buried him before riding north to rejoin the trapping-party.\n\nBut against all odds - Hugh survives. Regaining consciousness and finding himself alone, Hugh shrewdly deduces the identity of those who betrayed him. Then - fired by a relentless hate to punish those who left him to die - Hugh claws his painful way back to the land of the living: but only to set out to track down his betrayers and deal out some requisite summary justice.\n\n(Introduction by Nathan)\n\nFor more free audio books (in over 25 languages) or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2010-02-25"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["Librivox; poetry; Neihardt"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-02-25 12:02:28"],"addeddate":["2010-02-25 11:50:54"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-02-25 12:23:19","2011-05-31 10:57:33"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
