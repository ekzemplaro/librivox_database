Read by Debra Lynn.\n\n   A sportsman who doesn't hunt; a poet who doesn't write; a lover with no one to love; all three are devoted to their cheerful and benevolent leader, Mr. Pickwick. Join him and his friends, Winkle, Snodgrass, and Tupman, as they tour the country in search of adventures, knowledge, and stories. Along the way, they have their share of mishaps, and meet plenty of interesting characters, both the good and the not so good. (Mr. Pickwick's dedicated manservant, Sam Weller, is a scene-stealer sure to delight just about everybody.)\n\nYou may shed a few tears along the way, but usually of the pleasant sort. This is a mostly lighthearted and humorous tale, with a number of subplots woven in, in Dickens\u2019 incomparable style.<br \/><br \/>(Introduction by Debra Lynn)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/pickwick-papers-the-version-2-by-charles-dickens\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2010-09-07"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["LibriVox;Audiobook;English;Dickens"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-09-07 06:48:40"],"addeddate":["2010-09-07 06:30:41"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2010-09-07 06:51:55"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321015938[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020109"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"4.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I really enjoyed this tale - the portrayals of lawyers, doctors and politicians were quite funny.  I love how he introduces us to a character based on one observation - the fur topped boots of the woman we later come to know as Arabella.  You're not quite sure where he is going to take this character at first, but then he slowly unfolds the person before you and you think - how apt that first description was.\n\nI enjoy listening to DebraLynn's readings - she did another excellent job on this book.  Kudos to anyone who is dedicated enough to read through almost 30 hours of Dickens!","reviewtitle":"Lighthearted listen","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2011-04-12 13:55:49","stars":"4"}]},
