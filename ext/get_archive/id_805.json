The tales tell in a humorous way of his struggles with a new job, new culture, and with his landlord and neighbour Mr. \u2018Flurry\u2019 Knox whose prime, if not only, interest is in hunting, which forms the background to all the stories. Miss Somerville was herself the first woman anywhere to become an M.F.H.\n(Summary by A.J.M.)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/some-experiences-of-an-irish-rm-by-edith-oenone-somerville-and-martin-ross\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of complete book<\/a>\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>."],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; Edith Anna Somerville; Violet Florence Martin; comedy; politics;"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-03-22 20:11:39"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2007-03-23 09:43:22","2007-03-23 09:55:08","2011-08-11 09:57:50"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"date":["2007-03-23"],"year":["2007"],"runtime":["7:15:52"]},

Andy Minter does an excellent job of bringing them to life - complete with all the various accents from high to low on the social ladder.  \n\nAndy is among Librivox's most talented readers, especially when it comes to rural tales and rustic UK accents.

You captured the tone of the book perfectly and have done great credit to the characters and their ccents (in my humble opinion), in particular Flurry Knox!","reviewtitle":"Great book, great narrator","reviewer":"ahalin","reviewdate":"2012-05-09 06:23:42","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is one of those books in which an outsider enters a community of interesting eccentrics, and is fleeced, than embraced. I found it difficult to enjoy, because the protagonist doesn\u2019t actually motivate the plot, being carried along by others, and I didn\u2019t find the chief rogue charming enough. Recommended for those people who understand why the characters could find foxhunting interesting enough to write many, many chapters about it.\n\nThe reading is excellent, but the content never hit home for me.","reviewtitle":"I'm sorry to give this such a low score, because the reading is excellent.","reviewer":"Timothy Ferguson","reviewdate":"2013-04-03 13:23:17","stars":"3"}]},
