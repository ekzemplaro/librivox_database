In Watchbird, the question \"can machines solve human problems?\" is answered with a resounding YES! But there may be a few unforeseen glitches. Just a few. \n\nWarrior Race drops us into an alien race of warriors who fight in a way you will never be able to imagine until you listen. \n\nAnd Beside Still Waters is a gentle story that shows us a man who really wants to get away from it all ... sitting on a rock in the asteroid belt with only a robot for a friend. No girls allowed! A poignant and unsettling story to say the least. (Summary by Phil Chenevert) \n\n    For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), \n\nplease go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/watchbird-by-robert-sheckley\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n    For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-11-03"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["SF; science fiction;sheckley;audiobook;librivox"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"]},
