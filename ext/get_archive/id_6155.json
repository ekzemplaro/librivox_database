You have made me see the truth.  Indeed if one does criticize these precious readers who volunteer their time for free and one such as I cannot afford to buy cd's, It is cowardly of me and embarrassingly, ignorantly arrogant and just showing myself to be much worse than those I criticize who are earth angels, female and males, who give us there all for free. \n\nI will do my best never to criticize readers again.  I will do my utmost to restrict my comments on e.g. what I like or dislike about characters in the stories, or what i find good and not so good about the author's style, and so on.  And after listening again Ms. Lipshaw is surprisingly a fine reader.  And that conclusion does not come out of my guilt but from the fact of listening to her again.  Now I know not only will one be hurtful to a good, fine reader, but harms one's self after taking his or her frustration on another.  Yes it was cowardly displacement.\n\nthank you Donald Miller for your reprimand and admonition","reviewtitle":"Susan Glaspell is compassionate, perceptive insights of human nature","reviewer":"dahszil","reviewdate":"2014-09-30 04:42:21","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Okay. Let's agree that most people would like to have Orson Wells read these books. Or Lawrence Olivier. Perhaps Anthony Hopkins. Well, the way you arrive at that is to PURCHASE CDs read by the world's top talent. \n\nIn the world of Librivox, Ariel Lipshaw IS among the best readers. We're fortunate to have her generously donated time and talent. \n\nAriel does a fine job. Moreover, dissatisfaction is part of the human condition. As soon as you get Orson Wells (if he were still alive) to read a book, there's always someone saying Anthony Hopkins would have been better. We should be grateful for what we have. \n\nThanks Ariel.","reviewtitle":"Arielle Lipshaw Deserves Better","reviewer":"Donald R Miller","reviewdate":"2013-11-18 15:37:37","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"She speaks very clearly and I find her voice extremely charming.  But as for this book of short stories, the first one was cute, but then I got bored with the next couple, so I put it aside. Should I have persevered?","reviewtitle":"Arielle Lipshaw is a delightful reader","reviewer":"lanternland","reviewdate":"2014-08-21 03:55:09","stars":"3"}]},
