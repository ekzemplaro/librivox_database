Smith.\n\nReal men don't take guff from snotty kids. Neither does Disko Troop, skipper of the \"We're Here\", a fishing schooner out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, when his crew fishes Harvey Cheyne out of the Atlantic. There's no place on the Grand Banks for bystanders, so Harvey is press-ganged into service as a replacement for a man lost overboard and drowned. Harvey is heir to a vast fortune, but his rescuers believe none of what he tells them of his background. Disko won't take the boat to port until it is full of fish, so Harvey must settle in for a season at sea. Hard, dangerous work and performing it alongside a grab-bag of characters in close quarters is a life-changing experience.\n\nAnd when Harvey at last is reunited with his parents, who have thought him dead for months, he must face the hard decisions of how he will allow his experience to change his life. (Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/captains-courageous-by-rudyard-kipling\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2008-05-02"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks; fiction; adventure; saltwater fishing; rescues; teenage boys"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-05-02 23:04:40"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-05-03 00:26:47","2011-07-08 09:17:07","2012-01-01 07:40:24","2012-02-01 07:06:34"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"runtime":["5:56:59"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140318024535[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020413"]},

He was one of the first to recieve a Nobel for literature.","reviewtitle":"Captains  Courageous","reviewer":"Kevint50","reviewdate":"2008-05-09 23:03:36","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Thanks much to Mark F. Smith for a very nice reading of Captains Courageous by Rudyard Kipling. My favorite of his many voices was Disko Troop.\n\nI enjoyed the story too; lots of interesting characters.  (The long funeral scene didn't quite mesh with the adventure story, but of course abridged works are a different issue.)","reviewtitle":"a boy's adventure story; worthwhile","reviewer":"Scott S.

This ,in my opinion, is one of his best. Many thanks.","reviewtitle":"Excellent Tale","reviewer":"Steve Colby","reviewdate":"2012-08-25 03:58:51","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is a fantastic story.  I was not sure what to expect but I am very glad that I listened to this. \nIf you think that because you may have seen the film so you don't need to listen to this book - then think again - you are missing out if you do not listen to this story. \n\nMark Smith is an excellent reader and an asset to this project. I have listened to many books read by Mark and every time I am impressed by the high standard that he delivers.","reviewtitle":"Great Story and a great reader","reviewer":"LesM","reviewdate":"2013-10-25 02:42:51","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Mark Smith, as anyone who has heard him well knows, is a great reader, and Rudyard Kipling was, of course, a great writer.  But I don't think this is one of Kipling's better works. It drags on.","reviewtitle":"Mark Smith...","reviewer":"lanternland","reviewdate":"2014-07-15 01:17:01","stars":"3"}]},
