Read by Matthew Scott Surprenant.\n\nThis is the story of Mary Rowlandson\u2019s capture by American Indians in 1675. It is a blunt, frightening, and detailed work with several moments of off-color humor. Mary, the wife of a minister, was captured by Natives during King Philips War while living in a Lancaster town, most of which was decimated, and the people murdered. See through her eyes, which depict Indians as the instruments of Satan. Her accounts were a best-seller of the era, and a seminal work, being one of the first captivity narratives ever published by a woman. Without works such as hers, there would likely not be many modern works inspired by similar themes, such as The Searchers, starring John Wayne.(Summary by Matthew Scott Surprenant)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/a-narrative-of-the-captivity-and-restoration-of-mrs-mary-rowlandson-by-mary-rowlandson\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of complete book<\/a>\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"date":["2009-12-10"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["Librivox,Audiobook;Indians;Native Americans;Puritans;Colonial History;Memoirs;Captivity"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-12-10 04:14:16"],"addeddate":["2009-12-10 04:05:45"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-12-10 04:20:28","2009-12-10 05:04:19","2011-05-06 17:04:12"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321055716[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020312"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":4,"avg_rating":"4.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"<br \/>\nMary Rowlandson's account of her captivity among American Indians in New England in 1675 is both brutal and sympathetic. The Indians are portrayed as wild killers and slave owners, yet display moments of affection and kindness. One can see they are fighting for their lives, identity and way of life as they set out to kill the English in such numbers to drive them back into the sea. But it becomes clear the English are too many and despite victories in battle, there is an underlying desperation as the Indians stay on the run. Mary's memoir was among the first of the \"captivity narrative\" genre; and is an important historical document for her portraits of early American Indian life.\n\nListened to via LibriVox as read by Matthew Scott Surprenant. Clearly an amateur recording and difficult to follow at times as Matthew speeds too quickly through the words in places (pauses are good), but overall a strangely captivating reading style for the subject.\n\n[STB, 12-09, 300]","reviewtitle":"A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson","reviewer":"stbalbach","reviewdate":"2009-12-13 21:13:09","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"I am glad to see that my reading has been downloaded by so many people in so short a time.

The powers of man, over thier slaves and the levels of extreme powers they used upon them. This woman; Mary Rowlandson (captive) was a believer, who was given a bible, by an Indian man (captures) and it was her \"life saver\". Her three children, 6yrs -10yrs old. Youngest died in her arms, other two enslaved by other masters. She was powerless, but sought hope through the scriptures of her bible. Only saw her kids a few times throughout her 11week, 5day Captivity. Later, they all would be sold back to her husband\/father. There she learned many lessons... In the end they all learned to put there full trust \"surrender\" into there higher power\/ Creator. I was able to compare where we now are in America(235yrs later). Women and the American lifestyle. It both astonishes me and yet disappoints me to see; the enourmouse blessings of hard work, efforts and democracy has given us today but, how \"out of touch\" we have become. Our sense of true appreciation for the struggles of the backs of our ancestors of various culturas. Most of us, only seem to get sents\/whiffs of...","reviewtitle":"womens history seminal note of faith of a captive woman and her children","reviewer":"earthtomaui","reviewdate":"2011-02-14 20:33:18","stars":"4"}]},
