Howe. Read by Roger Melin.\n\nDavy's Bend was a dying, lonely, uncared for river town. So when a stranger showed up one day and bought the old unoccupied house called 'The Locks' one dreary day, the inhabitants of the town were naturally very curious about the stranger, and very curious about his reasons for buying the old house. The Locks had been known for years to display at nighttime a single light showing up in one room, and there was one room in the house which was strictly off-limits to anyone. What was the history behind The Locks that nobody dared to talk about? What was the reason for the stranger's unannounced arrival and purchase of The Locks? Small, dying towns tend to keep their secrets to themselves, and Davy's Bend was no exception. Nor was the stranger's. (Introduction by Roger Melin)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording. \n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1a\/MysteryOfTheLocksPart1.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B Part 1 (159MB)<\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1a\/MysteryOfTheLocksPart2.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B Part 2 (123MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2011-08-16"],"year":["2011"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; howe; mystery; locks"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2011-08-17 01:44:10"],"addeddate":["2011-08-17 00:23:31"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2011-08-17 02:03:15"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140326131342[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020204"]},

The best person can make a grave mistake, and those who feel wronged by that mistake may seek ultimate vengeance.  \n\nAlan Doris is a man with no past.  He moves to the run down city of Davy's Bend, where he moves into the mysterious house known as 'the locks'.  Despite his intentions of just living a quiet life, he meets the lovely Annie.  He tries to run away from that affection, but she doesn't let him go.  They marry and enjoy such happiness...  but there is no such thing as happily ever after.  \n\nI would have wished this story had a happier ending, but no loose ends are left, and the last chapter makes me think of a person looking over the sea as the sun sets.  \n\nRoger Melin is one of my favorite readers.  He has an excellent voice and cadence.  This is a good story overall, but I am going to have to listen to Wodehouse now...","reviewtitle":"Sad Story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2011-09-15 20:07:45","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This book contains some good writing and is very well read by Roger Melin. However, unlike the previous reviewer, I thought that the story meandered at times, and it definitely did not tie up all the loose ends.
