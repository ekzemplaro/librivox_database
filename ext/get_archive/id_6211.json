It contains practical directions accompanied by simple and fundamental exercises, first for the freeing of the voice and then for developing it when free.\"\n\nParts I and II of the book comprise advice on vocal production and techniques, while some chapters in Part III provide detailed guidance on the vocal interpretation of various literary genres, including the essay, various types of poetry, short stories, dramatic monologues and plays. Some chapters comprise mainly examples for practice, and include complete poems and stories.<br \/><br \/>The reader has endeavoured to follow the author's instructions, but makes no guarantee as to her success, especially in the poetic realm.\n\nAs suggested in the comments, the listener will find it most helpful to follow along with the text at <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/speakingvoicepri00everrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/speakingvoicepri00everrich<\/a>.\n\nFor further information, including details of poems and stories included, links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-speaking-voice-by-katherine-jewell-everts\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-02-15"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; voice; speech; training; instruction; poetry; short story; monologue; lyric poetry; didactic poetry; epic poetry; fable; essay; dramatic monologue; play; reading aloud; vocal interpretation; Shellley; Wordsworth; Coleridge; Tennyson; Browning; Emerson; Wilkins Freeman"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2012-02-15 10:45:50"],"addeddate":["2012-02-15 10:30:11"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2012-02-15 13:50:26"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140325050133[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020304"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"3.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Ruth is one of my favorite readers, which is why I picked this book - and as a reader myself, I thought I might pick up some tips.\n\nRuth delivers another excellent reading - my rating is principally because I didn't find the book terribly helpful.\n\nThe biggest take away was that all I learned about breathing and freeing the voice of tension from my singing lessons applies equally to the speaking voice - whether that is reading out loud or speaking before groups.\n\nIt was difficult to follow the examples and tips for reading various types of poetry and prose without the text of the poem (or essay or whatever) in front of me.  Would recommend that others pull down a copy of the text so they can better follow along in the interpretation sections.","reviewtitle":"Another excellent reading by Ruth Golding!","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2012-05-14 00:22:44","stars":"3"}]},
