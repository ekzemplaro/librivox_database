Beam Piper & John J. McGuire. Read by Mark Nelson\n\nNew Texas: its citizens figure that name about says it all. The Solar League ambassador to the Lone Star Planet has the unenviable task of convincing New Texans that a s'Srauff attack is imminent, and dangerous. Unfortunately it's common knowledge that the s'Srauff are evolved from canine ancestors\u2014and not a Texan alive is about to be scared of a talking dog! But unless he can get them to act, and fast, there won't be a Texan alive, scared or otherwise!

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.67"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"The new ambassador of Lone Star planet needs to learn who killed his predecessor and why.  He also needs to find a way to bring this planet into the federation.  How to accomplish these things on a planet where if a person acts improperly, they can be shot and the murderer is exonerated?  Interesting storyline, kept me involved and listening up to the end.\n\nReader was also very good.","reviewtitle":"Awesome Story!","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2009-11-04 00:20:00","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I love Pipers variations on pollitics in the worlds he creates, on The Lone Star Planet you can kill pollitical representatives if you feel that they have not represented the people's intrests....What a idea, though this does present some problems, hence the plot of the story. This book is a little like a John Grisham novel but with intergalactic intricacies and more action, I recommend it.","reviewtitle":"Hi-tech Texans, yeehaw!","reviewer":"Pyrodin123321","reviewdate":"2010-01-25 19:53:25","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"An interesting and relatively undemanding tale, with some amiable satirical swipes at Texas mores and political assassination here. The story moves along fairly briskly, although the prospect of a central female romance is undeveloped.\n\nThe reader is generally good.","reviewtitle":"Politicians beware","reviewer":"Arch Stanton","reviewdate":"2010-03-02 18:39:49","stars":"4"}]},
