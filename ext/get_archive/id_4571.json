Read by Gregg Margarite (1957-2012).\n\nHonath the Pursemaker is a heretic. He doesn\u2019t believe the stories in the Book of Laws which claims giants created his tree-dwelling race. He makes his opinion known and is banished with his infidel friends to the floor of the jungle where dangers abound. Perhaps he\u2019ll find some truth down there. \u2013 The Thing in the Attic is one of Blish\u2019s Pantropy tales and was first published in the July, 1954 edition of If, Worlds of Science Fiction magazine.

They end up in 'hell' where the 'demons' exist.  Can they survive long enough to discover the secret of the jungle floor?  \n\nThis is a neat story, I would have loved it to be better developed.  \n\nThe recordings were a little bass-heavy, I struggled with them a bit, but otherwise, its a great story.
