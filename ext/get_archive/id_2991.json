"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This short story has a lot going on in it, but its still a good story.  I had to listen to it 3x to take it all in.\n\nEarth doesn't fight wars.  Earth is neutral in all wars.  Oddly enough, no one ever fights Earth. Oh they might think about it, and talk about it, and even start a war nearby to take out the other planets that would protect Earth, but no one ever quite gets to Earth.\n\nDuke just returned from fighting one of those wars.  He is disgusted with what he perceives as the cowardice of his home planet.  Imagine his surprise when he is recruited by that planet to serve in a higher capacity...  just maybe he might learn the secret of why Earth seems so cowardly and yet so untouchable.  \n\nGregg M is an awesome reader.  Thanks Gregg for another sci-fi goodie!\n","reviewtitle":"A little busy...but still a good story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2011-10-11 14:17:40","stars":"5"}]},
