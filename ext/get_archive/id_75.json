Stowe was a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active abolitionist. The novel is believed to have had a profound effect on the North\u2019s view of slavery. In fact, when he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, President Lincoln is said to have commented, \"So you're the little lady whose book started the Civil War.\" First published on March 20, 1852, the story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, the central character around whose life the other characters\u2014both fellow slaves and slave owners\u2014revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings. (Summary by Wikipedia and John Greenman)\n\nNote From the Reader: The listener is about to enter a world rich with diverse characters.

In 1852 the story was published in book form in two volumes. Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best seller in the United States, England, Europe, Asia, and translated into over 60 languages. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, which deeply distressed Harriet, was a factor in inspiring her to write Uncle Tom's Cabin. This Act made it a crime for citizens of free states to give aid to runaway enslaved people.\nUncle Tom's Cabin humanized slavery by telling the story of individuals and families. Harriet portrayed the physical, sexual, and emotional abuse endured by enslaved people. When she created the character of Eliza, the slave mother, Harriet drew upon her own experiences. In 1849 Harriet's own son Charley died of cholera when he was only eighteen months old. While remembering Charley's death, Harriet thought about how terrible it would be for a slave mother to lose a child because the child was sold. She wondered how a slave mother would feel, never knowing what happened to her own child.\nA highly recommended reading. Many thanks to Mr John Greenman for his excellent performance.","reviewtitle":"An excellent recording","reviewer":"Philippe Horak","reviewdate":"2008-04-07 13:15:38","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Awesome reader, made the story super clear!
