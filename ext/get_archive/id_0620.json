When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferrars, a match that seems much more suitable. All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways. \nSince this is an Austen novel and a romance, be assured that all comes right in the end.(Summary by Michelle Crandall)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/sense-and-sensibility-by-jane-austen\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/0_sense_and_sensibility_librivox\/SenseAndSensibilityPart1_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B part1(165mb)<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/0_sense_and_sensibility_librivox\/SenseAndSensibilityPart2_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B part2(170mb)<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; romance; England;"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-03-30 06:03:05"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2007-03-30 06:19:25","2011-10-04 04:18:38"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140317220549[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020219"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"],"runtime":["12:11:09"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"],"date":["2007-03-30"],"year":["2007"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"2.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I love this book, but it is hard to enjoy chapters 27-29 read by Kelly Bescherer. Her \"This is a librivox recording\" intro is well timed for this book, however, once she starts reading the actual chapters, she sounds as if she has joined a marathon. \"Maryanne\" sounds like \"Marion\" and she seems to gasp for breath after the end of paragraphs. The end of sentences run together. I love anything read by Kara Shallenberg, who has a wonderful voice, the perfect pace, and draws you into each book. But based on the fast reading of Kelly Bescherer, I say go for version 2 of Sense and Sensibility off Librivox read by Mark F. Smith.

There were so many varying readers that by the time I was familiar with a reader, it changed. There were a wide range of lisps, accents, and speeds that were   not pleasant to listen to. I took the recommendation of the first 2 comments and must agree.","reviewtitle":"Hodge Podge","reviewer":"AnneC1379","reviewdate":"2013-09-24 20:16:05","stars":"2"}]},
