He is regarded as a major \"innovator in the art of the short story\"; his children's books are enduring classics of children's literature; and his best work speaks to a versatile and luminous narrative gift.  \n\nDan and Una met Puck last summer, in <u>Puck of Pook's Hill<\/u>. This summer, they meet him again - and several individuals from different periods in history, who, while generally not famous themselves, tell their tales of meeting Queen Elizabeth, Francis Drake, George Washington, and other well-known historical figures. Sadly, Dan and Una forget these encounters as soon as they are over, but the reader can enjoy them for years to come!
