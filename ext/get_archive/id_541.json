Smith\n\nDeep in the heart of every parent is the wish, the desire, to have other adults tell us, in an unsolicited way, just how very polite one's child is!  This perhaps was even more the case in 1903, when Gelett Burgess produced his second book on the Goops.  With entertaining cartoons - cariacatures of misbehaving children - he described many different breaches of tact and good manners.<br \/><br \/>Burgess wrote several books of poetry on the Goops, each poem describing some significant way in which an unthoughtful or unkind child could offend polite society and often offering the hope that the listener would never behave that way.  Ahem!  Well, perhaps very few people have succeeded in not acting Goop-like at some point in their lives, but read along with Burgess as he attempts to define, in a humorous fashion, exactly what the differences between \"Good\" and \"Goop\" are!<br \/>(Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/more-goops-and-how-not-to-be-them-by-gelett-burgess\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"subject":["librivox;  audiobook;  literature; poetry; children"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-04-25 23:12:16"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","ARossi","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-04-25 23:12:48","2006-04-27 11:46:59","2006-04-28 21:12:58"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"]},
