Read by Sam Stinson.\n\nAn additional six chapters appear interspersed in Esther in the Septuagint, the Greek translation, which then was noted by Jerome in compiling the Latin Vulgate; additionally, the Greek text contains many small changes in the meaning of the main text. The extra chapters include several prayers to God, perhaps because it was felt that the above-mentioned lack of mention of God was inappropriate in a holy book. Jerome recognized them as additions not present in the Hebrew Text and placed them at the end of his Latin translation as chapters 10:4-16:24. However, some modern Catholic English Bibles restore the Septuagint order, such as Esther in the NAB. \n\n(Summary by Wikipedia)\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2008-06-28"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; audio book; bible; douay-rheims; esther; additions to esther; apocrypha; deuterocanon; old testament; tanakh"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-06-28 12:24:55"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2008-06-28 12:43:58"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"]},
