Solomon and Etta Ellen were married in McBride, Montcalm County, Michigan. Solomon resided in Chicago, Illinois for a time before taking up his principal residence in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Rev. Shaw labored on what he referred to as the \"undenominational line\". This stand constituted a middle ground between the association plan favored by the denomination-oriented members of the National and the independent congregationalists of the movement. \"Our work is not to build up or tear down churches, but to save souls and to lead God's people into the glorious experience of entire sanctification regardless of denominational lines,\" he said. - Summary by Tim Cote<br \/><br \/> For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/childrens-edition-of-touching-incidents-and-remarkable-answers-to-prayer-by-solomon-benjamin-shaw\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.<br \/><br \/> For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1b\/touchingincidents_1309.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (72mb)<\/a>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"mediatype":["audio"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks;children; religion; prayer; Christian living"],"title":["Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"],"publicdate":["2013-09-19 17:57:45"],"addeddate":["2013-09-19 17:57:45"],"year":["2013"],"boxid":["OL100020417"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"],"runtime":["2:43:06"]},
