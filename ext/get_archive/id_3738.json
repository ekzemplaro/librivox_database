Read by skoval.\n\nIllegitimacy, false identity, and bankruptcy are the major elements of Sir Walter Scott's 1816 novel, The Antiquary. Set in the period of the French Revolution, the novel's hero, Lovel, struggles to gain repute and the hand of his beloved despite his uncertain parentage. During these pursuits, he befriends the title's antiquary, Johnathan Oldbuck, who finds Lovel a captive audience to his scholarly studies and a tragic likeness to his own disappointments in love. Readers will discover whether Lovel's acts of bravery and courage ultimately earn him the birth and fortunes of a nobleman. (Summary by S. Kovalchik)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-antiquary-by-sir-walter-scott\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2010-02-21"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; literature; fiction; French Revolution"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-02-21 16:44:20"],"addeddate":["2010-02-21 14:57:59"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2010-02-21 18:05:46"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321054019[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020416"]},
