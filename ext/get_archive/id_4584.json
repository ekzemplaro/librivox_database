"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.33"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This is a charming short comedy.  The principal actors get the most out of every ironic line and situation.  Highly recommended.","reviewtitle":"Subtle entertainment","reviewer":"aposiopesis","reviewdate":"2010-10-23 03:20:48","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is a short and funny bit of drama.  I would recommend it as well.\n\nIn the Librivox drama world, each reader separately records their lines and submits them to a book editor, who in turn cleans, amplifies and pastes the parts together to make a coherent whole.  With that in mind, the readers and the BC on this project did an excellent job of creating a whole story that flows smoothly from reader to reader.","reviewtitle":"Charming piece","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2011-04-28 19:34:22","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This is a sort of comedy of manners. I enjoyed it, but at the same time thought it was about the right length: longer and I think it would have been too much. I think its because the writer's style is intricate and artificial, so that although people really did speak like that in the day, now it seems rather like a sort of clockwork or kabuki. Utterly false to the way modern people sound, and yet still interesting as an experience.\n\nMartin Geeson does really well as the romantic lead in this.  Martin's voice reminds me of some early Alan Rickman I saw once, for some reason.  It's not that the sound similar, but there's a certain intricacy of ennunciation which is quite lovely.","reviewtitle":"An interesting experience","reviewer":"Timothy Ferguson","reviewdate":"2011-10-29 01:23:47","stars":"4"}]},
