Read by TriciaG.\n\n\"Narrative of my captivity among the Sioux Indians: with a brief account of General Sully's Indian expedition in 1864, bearing upon events occurring in my captivity\"\n\n\"I was a member of a small company of emigrants, who were attacked by an overwhelming force of hostile Sioux, which resulted in the death of a large proportion of the party, in my own capture, and a horrible captivity of five months' duration. Of my thrilling adventures and experience during this season of terror and privation, I propose to give a plain, unvarnished narrative, hoping the reader will be more interested in facts concerning the habits, manners, and customs of the Indians, and their treatment of prisoners, than in theoretical speculations and fine-wrought sentences.\" (Summary from Introduction) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/narrative-of-my-captivity-by-fanny-kelly\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\nM4B format available"],"subject":["LibriVox; audiobook; memoir; biography; Sioux; Ogalalla; Blackfeet; frontier life; barbarism; cruelty; massacre; General Sully"],"creator":["Fanny Kelly"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"identifier":["narrative_captivity_tg_librivox"],"addeddate":["2013-04-10 17:39:02"],"publicdate":["2013-04-10 17:39:54"],"date":["2013-04-10"],"year":["2013"]},
