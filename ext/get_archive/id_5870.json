Splendid team work, however, has made success possible.\n\nEvery author represented, every worker on the team, has gratuitously contributed his or her services; and every dollar realized by the serial and book publication of \"The Sturdy Oak\" will be devoted to the Suffrage Cause. But the novel itself is first of all a very human story of American life today. It neither unduly nor unfairly emphasizes the question of equal suffrage, and it should appeal to all lovers of good fiction.
