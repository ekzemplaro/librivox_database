In some translations, this book is entitled <em>The Song of Solomon<\/em>. It is also known as <em>The Best Song<\/em>.<br \/><br \/>Replete with metaphor, this book is a love song that describes the wooing and wedding of a lowly but very comely shepherdess to the great king Solomon. It speaks of the joys of love as well as its heartaches.<br \/><br \/>Although this reading was performed by a single male voice, the book has three main speakers: the Shulamite shepherdess, King Solomon and a chorus by the daughters of Jerusalem. Biblical scholars also note the allegorical depictions of God as King and the bride as Israel. In New Testament doctrine, the bride is thought of as the Church and Christ as King.<br \/><br \/><em>The Song of Songs<\/em> is one of the Wisdom Books. This reading comes from the American Standard Version (ASV) of the Holy Bible.<br \/>(Summary by <a href=\"http:\/\/climber53.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Garrison<\/a>)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-song-of-songs-by-solomon\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox;  audiobook;  literature; solomon; bible"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-06-05 00:02:51"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","ARossi","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-06-05 07:09:46","2006-06-05 23:11:02","2011-10-15 09:45:11"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
