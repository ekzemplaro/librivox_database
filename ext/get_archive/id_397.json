Are you from Australia?\n\nAnyway, I really love this poem, and it is complemented beautifully by your reading.","reviewtitle":"Great Accent","stars":"5","reviewer":"WordJockey","reviewdate":"2006-09-17 22:13:42"},{"reviewbody":"Thank for proofreading my typo's alamedared, good on you, if you are up to it, could please proofread the entire internet of typos, and while you are at it, since you are going to point out typos, please go back and punctuate your own messages properly. It's a shame that you you believe you are teaching people grammar or spelling, but it doesn't take a middle school grad to identify typos- have you ever txt'ed before? Join us here in the 21st century, but leave your \"English Degree\" at home, where WordJockey left his history degree. Geez, what kind of a jerk goes around identifying typos on a message board...pathetic.","reviewtitle":"what an idiot","reviewer":"dearjym","reviewdate":"2008-05-16 22:32:31"},{"reviewbody":"Let's not go on about each other's comments---let's all just keep reading and listening.  Oh, by the way, \"were\" is not the correct spelling---you should have typed \"we're\" or \"we are\".   Time to listen to another book.","reviewtitle":"who is stupid?","reviewer":"alamedared","reviewdate":"2008-05-11 03:56:26","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I love this","reviewtitle":"The Raven","reviewer":"krystalsmeagol2","reviewdate":"2010-07-07 03:27:14","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I give this five stars.","reviewtitle":"Reading of E.

I have loved this poem ever since I first read it as a child. This gentleman's reading of it is excellent. Thanks.","reviewtitle":"Great reader","reviewer":"lindaisling","reviewdate":"2013-03-29 16:00:02","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"thank YOU!  My favorite poem since I was 8 years old.
