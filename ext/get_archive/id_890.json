Beautiful to the point of tears, painful, haunting, hilarious, it never fails to touch me.\n\nIt is also decidedly the best librivox recording I have heard so far. Peter Bobbe conveys all the passion, the lust for life and the sadness in his reading. Highly recommendable.","reviewtitle":"Marvellous.","reviewer":"lorcas_ghost","reviewdate":"2011-02-18 16:02:11","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is perhaps the best LibriVox recording on the Archive. Peter Bobbe does an exceptional job reading this. He has a quintessential narrator's voice and inflection. This could be a professional recording. 100,000+ downloads and counting for a reason. \n\nA superb recording of a timeless classic. James Joyce is god.","reviewtitle":"Extraordinary","reviewer":"Folkhippy","reviewdate":"2012-08-09 17:47:06","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"A young man's journey from passion to belief to skepticism. Quite an indictment of certain religious dogmas, too.  Outstanding reading of this early modern classic.  A fully professional rendition complete with perfect pronunciation and emphasis.\n\nHighly recommended. \n\nTheBookworm (Manchester, UK)","reviewtitle":"Portrait of the Artist","reviewer":"TheBookworm","reviewdate":"2012-09-20 03:08:58","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Many thanks .This is a souperb performance.....it is not a reading..it is truly a performance.Mr Bobbe is an artist.","reviewtitle":"Splendid","reviewer":"gjlebowski","reviewdate":"2012-09-21 10:40:41","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"As mentioned elsewhere, Peter Bobbe is an artist who brings his best performance to Joyce's classic.
