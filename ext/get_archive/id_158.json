I was taken aback when I first listened to the book and suddenly found that the reader had changed. There's a lot to be said for having a single reader unless you use different people for the various characters.  \n\nI tried to listen to Tom Crawford's version, but did not find that to my tastes either. I'm a sad case, I know, since I'm sure all concerned are better readers than me.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm trying to join LibriVox as a reader, but will shy away from the reader per chapter process. Just my personal preference.","reviewtitle":"Love the book, love librivox, hate splitting up books","reviewer":"Mcdowellray","reviewdate":"2010-11-26 08:50:17","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"To McDowellray,\n\nThere is another solo Librivox recording of Call of the Wild, read by Mark Smith.
