Concerned that many people do not display true \"religious affections,\" Jonathan Edwards attempts to \"discern...wherein true religion does consist.\" Balancing between extreme \"intellectualism\" and extreme \"emotionalism,\" Edwards argues that emotions are an important part of true religion, but that one must distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate emotions. He provides both \"negative\" or unreliable signs of true religious emotions, and \"positive\" or reliable signs of true religious emotions. Religious Affections is thus profitable for study even today, and many contemporary theologians and pastors have found Edward's work insightful and significant. For its historical importance and its continuing insights, Religious Affections is highly recommended. - Summary by Christian Classics Ethereal Library (www.ccel.org)<br \/> For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.<br \/><br \/> For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"mediatype":["audio"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks;Christianity; faith; emotions; revival"],"title":["Religious Affections"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"],"publicdate":["2015-01-27 14:40:40"],"addeddate":["2015-01-27 14:40:40"]},
