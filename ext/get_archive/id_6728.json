Josiah Priest, A. M. 5th edition. <\/i>\n\nThis is a compilation of pro-slavery literature and propaganda that went through numerous editions in the Southern United States before the Civil War. It contains the highly influential book, Slavery, as it Relates to the Negro, or African Race, by Rev Josiah Priest, which was originally published in 1843. This compilation also includes many essays and favorable reviews of Rev Priest\u2019s book from contemporary magazines and newspapers, and written endorsements from national politicians. \n\nFrom the preface: \u2018The question, \u201cIs slavery, as it exists in the United States, justifiable?\u201d is one which, at least, admits of discussion. If it be in harmony with the immutable principles of truth and justice, and not a \u201ccrime against humanity,\u201d and a libel upon our holy religion, let it be so understood and practiced by our honest citizens, whose highest ambition consists in faithfully serving God, and living in obedience to the laws of the country.\u2019 (Summary by JoeD)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/bible-defence-of-slavery-by-josiah-priest\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-08-14"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; slavery; history"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"]},
