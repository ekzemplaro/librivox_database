Read by Gregg Margarite (1957-2012).\n\nArthur Chamberlain has problems. His one-man engineering firm is faltering and his pretty secretary Estelle barely notices him. But these problems are put aside when his Manhattan office building falls into the fourth dimension. Madison Square is filled with wigwams and it\u2019s up to Arthur to engineer a way to make his building to fall back to the future. \u2013 The Runaway Skyscraper first appeared in the February 22, 1919 issue of Argosy magazine.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":2,"avg_rating":"4.50"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Not sure this is much of a sci-fi, more of a romance with a little adventure on the side.  Arthur goes back in time, and bands the people together and they come back.  The story focuses mostly on his relationship with his secretary, so there isn't a lot of action.  I think the story was a bit short and kind of short-changed the character and plot development.\n\nReader was great tho, no complaints, and kudos also to him for a clean recording.  I didn't have to fiddle with the GE, just set it to 'speech' and it was great.  Thanks Greg!  :-)","reviewtitle":"Cute story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-05-13 17:59:09","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"It was a cute story, just a nice little short one to hold your interest.  The narration was brilliant though, this guy reminded me of Rod Serling from the Twilight Zone.","reviewtitle":"Agreeing with MikeZane","reviewer":"benefitsingers","reviewdate":"2011-02-11 17:11:59","stars":"5"}]},
