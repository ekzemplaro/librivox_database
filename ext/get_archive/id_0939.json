Read by Tim Bulkeley.\n\nRudyard Kipling published Stalky & Co. in 1899. Set at an English boarding school in a seaside town on the North Devon coast. (The town, Westward Ho!, is not only unusual in having an exclamation mark, but also in being itself named after a novel, by Charles Kingsley.)\n\nThe book is a collection of linked short stories, with some information about the eponymous Stalky's later life. Beetle, one of the main trio, is said to be based on Kipling himself, while Stalky may be based on Lionel Dunsterville.\n\nThe stories have elements of the macabre (dead cats), bullying and violence, and hints about sex, making them far from the childish or idealised world of the typical school story. Edmund Wilson, critic, in The Wound and the Bow, was both shocked and uncomprehending. (Summary adapted by Tim Bulkeley from the Wikipedia entry)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/stalky-and-co-by-rudyard-kipling\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/stalky_tb_librivox\/StalkyAndCo_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (196MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2007-04-30"],"year":["2007"],"subject":["LibriVox; literature; audiobook; kipling; boarding school;"],"publicdate":["2007-04-30 21:03:32"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2007-04-30 21:05:51","2007-05-06 23:49:57","2011-08-11 09:58:43"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140318154552[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020413"],"runtime":["6:25:54"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"]},

His reading was as good as many professional audiobooks I've bought and the sound quality was also well done.\n\nI grew up loving Stalky & Co (they were the original \"Marauders\" before JK Rowling invented James Potter & Co for her series and Stalky still wins hands down, without any magic at all!). If you haven't read the stories then this download is a great introduction. And if you have read the stories this is an excellent way to enjoy them again.\n","reviewtitle":"A really excellent series of stories!","reviewer":"vladadog","reviewdate":"2007-12-30 19:02:13","stars":"5"}]},
