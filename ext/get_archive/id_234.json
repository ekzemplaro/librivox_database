E. Marshall.  Read by Kara Shallenberg.  This is the first half of the book.  Part 2 may be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/our-island-story-part-2-by-he-marshall\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/librivox.org\/our-island-story-part-2-by-he-marshall\/<\/a>.\n\nOur Island Story was first published in 1905 and became an instant classic. Beginning with the Romans and following the triumphs and foibles of the good, not so good and the downright despicable figures of history; we are treated to a dazzling montage of kings, queens, barons, knights, explorers, movers and shakers that have played a key role in the history of England. Marshall freely mixes folk tale with historical fact and in so doing paints a very vivid picture of the past in a style reminiscent of all that is finest in the children's story telling tradition.This is the first section of that work and will carry you from the time when Tacitus first sang the praises of Britannica to his Roman readers up to the vicious and bloodthirsty confusion that is the War of the Roses (about 1500 years). (Summary by Jim)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/our-island-story-part-1-by-he-marshall\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2006-07-15"],"year":["2006"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; children; history; england; legends; marshall"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-07-15 09:04:13"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","ARossi","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-07-15 16:43:42","2006-07-15 18:11:19","2006-07-15 18:43:50","2006-08-01 22:37:40","2011-04-30 07:49:58"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140318031552[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020215"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},

Marshall does not investigate the socio-political background behind events or apply economic theory to the past. Instead she tells the legend of Boudica in the same narrative style as a story about the signing of the Magna Carta.\n\nFor complete review and other audiobook reviews, visit www.freelistens.blogspot.com","reviewtitle":"Free Listens review","reviewer":"Sayeth","reviewdate":"2010-07-20 13:10:19","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I see it's been available for almost 8 years now, so since no one updated this @ Librivox or here, here's the link...\n\nhttps:\/\/archive.org\/details\/our_island_story_2_librivox","reviewtitle":"\"A Link to the Second\"...","reviewer":"eschiss1","reviewdate":"2014-09-02 16:03:25"},{"reviewbody":"Yes, sorry about that.
