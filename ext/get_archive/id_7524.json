That romance is now ended, and our grandchildren will hardly believe its leading incidents except on irresistible testimony. I rejoice that you are collecting and presenting that testimony, and heartily wish you a great success.\" Horace Greeley.<br \/><br \/>William Still is often called the Father of the Underground Railroad. Over 14 years, he helped hundreds of slaves escape to freedom in Canada. Still was committed to preserving the stories of the bondmen and he kept careful records of the many escaped slaves who passed through the Philadelphia \u201cstation\u201d. The Underground Railroad was published in 1871 from Still\u2019s records and diaries. In bringing you these stories, Librivox volunteers are reading from the 1878 edition.
