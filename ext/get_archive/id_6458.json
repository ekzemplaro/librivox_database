What defense could Earth devise against science such as this? In the far future of 1972, on a secret military installation, Staff Sergeant Bellews is an expert on the latest scientific discovery: a way for ordinary machines like vacuums and lawnmowers to gather experience in their jobs, becoming error free over time.  Then the strange broadcasts began to blow up transmitters everywhere.  Were they from space? Enemies? the future? He didn't care until they started messin' with his machines.  Then he took it personally. (summary from the first chapter and Phil Chenevert) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"paste%20or%20type%20link%20to%20LV%20catalog%20page%20here\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-04-04"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["librivox; science fiction;short story;leinster"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2012-04-05 02:07:05"]},

The way the hero gets the bad guys is a great bit of twist. \n\nExcellent reading too, enjoy!\n","reviewtitle":"Love Leinster","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2012-05-21 22:54:31","stars":"5"}]},
