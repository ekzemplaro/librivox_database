"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":2,"avg_rating":"4.50"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"The Barsoom series of books are a steam punk type of story where heros leap around waving swords at the bad guys even when they can all lay their hands on firearms.\n\nThis story follows a familar Barsoom pattern of a journey across unknown parts of Mars and encounters with new races of \"men\". A woman in trouble needs rescuing and a manly sword waving hero is close at hand.\n\nWhen you listen to these Barsoom stories there is never any doubt about a happy ending being around the corner but that's not the best part of the stories. It's the adventure and action that make the story worth listening to. In common with all of the other Barsoom stories I've listened to, this is a jolly good listen!\n\nIn this story the woman in trouble is John Carter's daughter who becomes lost and needs a heroic red man to come to her rescue. Which of course he does. We find at least two new martian races to complicate things and the usual collection of predator type animals to threaten everyone.\n\nIf you've enjoyed any of the other Barsoom stories and liked them, you can move onto this story with confidence.\n\nThe reading in this novel is pretty good, but there is a rather odd thing here. There are two versions of the first couple of chapters by different readers. I have no explanation for why that may be, it's odd.\n\nRead more of my reviews of Free Audio Books over at http:\/\/FreeAudioReview.BlogSpot.com","reviewtitle":"Free Audio Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2009-04-28 19:59:52","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"\nThis is probably the best of his work\n\nTarzan of the Apes\nJohn Carter of Mars\nCarson Napier of venus\n\nHeroes who overcome vast odds.
