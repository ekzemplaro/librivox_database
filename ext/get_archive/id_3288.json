Smith. Read by Mark F. Smith.\n\n\u201cDoc\u201d E.E. Smith pretty much invented the space opera genre, and Triplanetary is a good and well-known example. Physics, time, and politics never stand in the way of a plot that gallops ahead without letup.\nHaving earned a PhD in chemical engineering, it\u2019s understandable that the heroes of Smith\u2019s story are all scientists. He didn\u2019t want to be constrained by the limits of known science, however, so in his hands the electromagnetic spectrum becomes a raw material to be molded into ever-more amazing and lethal forms, and the speed of light is no bar to traveling through the interstellar void.\nCome enjoy this story of yesteryear, set in tomorrow, where real women ignite love at a glance, real men achieve in days what governments manage in decades, and aliens are an ever-present threat to Life-As-We-Know-It! (Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/triplanetary-by-ee-doc-smith\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks3\/Triplanetary_64kb.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of complete book<\/a>"],"date":["2009-07-21"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; sience fiction; Triplanetary; E.E.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":4,"avg_rating":"4.50"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This story starts off with high sci fi action, moves into the middle story with high action and speeds into a high action ending! It never relents. Fight, fear and foe are the watch words of this narrative with fight being to the fore.\n\nTriplanetary is a government like organisation that spans the three populated planets of Earth's solar system, and it has many enemies. The story starts with pirates being ... piratanical within the solar system and moves into an attack by seemingly unstoppable aliens with weapons that can tear worlds apart.\n\nThe story keeps your attention and the reader is excellent, a near perfect combination for fans of classic sci fi.\n\nI heartily recommend this Librivox presentation.\n\nRead more of my reviews of Free Audio Books at http:\/\/FreeAudioReview.blogspot.com","reviewtitle":"Free Audio Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2009-08-15 11:36:54","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Cheesy as hell but grabs you and whisks you along for the wild ride. Well read Mr. Smith.","reviewtitle":"A heck of a trip","reviewer":"Boggins","reviewdate":"2010-01-20 15:57:29","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This story really started out great and even seemed quite contemporary in the beginning....  However, the farther along it went, the more improbable and predictable it got. By the end I didn't finish listening to the final chapter...  No worries, I think the first three quarters of the story were worth a listen as Doc Smith had some great ideas that would be quite revolutionary in their day. Towards the end, it got a little too absurd and predictable to hold my attention.\n\nAgain, I want to state that Doc Smith had some revolutionary ideas for his time that made this story a great listen for 90% of the tale. \n\nUnfortunately the \"love interest\" part really showed the banal shortcomings of it's era. By the end, a ray or a beam for every affliction or problem was predictable by its boring redundancy. \n\nDespite all my complaints, as compared to other works of the contemporaries, I still want to give this four stars. (How do ya figure???)\n\nMr Mark Smith gives a FANTASTIC performance in his reading! Such a talent! Librivox, The Internet Archive, and all those who get the benefit of these works are so fortunate for all those folks who selflessly devote their time and talents.  I know I speak for countless others when I offer a million thanks to all those involved!","reviewtitle":"Starts great....","reviewer":"gl1200phil","reviewdate":"2011-02-15 05:36:28","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"I loved how the perspectives of different alien races is involved, it makes for a great story.\n\nThe people of Sol (Earth) are just dumb monkey apes who have LOTS of iron in their cities and in their blood! The Nevians plan to have all of it, since they are just dumb animals, it is no big loss. The people of Sol are much more than that, and prove it.\n\nMark Smith is an excellent reader. This story has two versions on LV, and I have listened to them both.  I am hoping that the sequels are read next! What a ride!\n\nOh, and I don't expect Star Wars quality stories since they are older stories from an earlier time. I just want a good story that takes me away from my desk, and this does exactly that. :-)  Enjoy!\n\n","reviewtitle":"This is a great story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2011-10-19 13:27:33","stars":"5"}]},
