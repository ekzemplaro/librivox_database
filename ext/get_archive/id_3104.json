The reason?  They need him to testify on behalf of a primative group of humans that live on another planet.  Will the astronaut help, or will he side with the native intelligent life on that planet, a group of super intelligent lizards who hunt and train humans like pets.  \n\nWhat would you do?  \n\n","reviewtitle":"Well....","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2014-10-15 20:05:13","stars":"4"}]},
