"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":9,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This is a series of extremely well-argued lectures especially questioning the origins and justification for gods and religion. Laden with irony and wit, Ingersoll makes the case that a rational outlook cannot be reconciled with a dogmatic (religious) mind. \nGiven that examining religion has become such a hot topic (\"The End of Faith\", \"The God Delusion\"), I found it fascinating to hear Ingersoll's arguments. He challenges the listener,  even as he entertains. As public lectures, these definitely benefit from being heard rather than read, and the reader does an excellent job at presenting them with this in mind.","reviewtitle":"Ingersoll's plea for free-thinking","reviewer":"al3","reviewdate":"2007-08-29 07:13:38","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I'd heard of Col. Ingersoll from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, http:\/\/www.ffrf.org.  I was thrilled when I found them available for download.  I've listened to all of the recordings once and have them queued up for a second time.  His words are as insightful and timely now as they were then.  They were not only uplifting but a downright inspiration to my freethinking mind.  Many thanks to Ted for the obvious effort and quality that went into the recording of this.  I would highly recommend it to everyone who is interested in thinking for themselves.","reviewtitle":"Excellent, Spread The Word","reviewer":"ed.elfrink@gmail.com","reviewdate":"2007-10-09 00:47:50","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"While Ingersoll's lectures are filled with thought-provoking ideas and impeccable logic, they also reveal his intoxicating sense of humour, which is only enhanced by Ted's charismatic reading of the text.\n\nIf you harbour doubts about the religion that you have been taught to blindly accept; if you have difficulty reconciling the contradiction that an all-merciful god would sentence his children to eternal fire for expressing such doubts, then Ingersoll's lectures will enable you to rid your mind of these superstitions... And you will have a chuckle or two along the way!\n\nBy the way, you are welcome to join the \"Robert Ingersoll fan club\" on facebook:\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=2366542207","reviewtitle":"Timeless wisdom that is also fun to listen to!","reviewer":"_kdd_","reviewdate":"2008-02-20 17:37:29","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"These lectures are still so timely its scary. Ingersoll's words made me think, and at times made me smile. I wish more people would read his work.\nThese audio reads by Ted are wonderful. He did a great job bringing these lectures to life. Very entertaining!","reviewtitle":"Wonderful words, wonderful audio!","reviewer":"hwills","reviewdate":"2008-06-02 13:18:36","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Robert Green Ingersoll was an electrifying orator, and his works were meant to be heard.\n\nIn his day, no other human being had been seen and heard by more Americans - or would be until the advent of motion pictures, radio, and television. After hearing Ingersoll speak, Samuel Clemens wrote: \"What an organ is human speech when it is employed by a master!\" \n\nTed Delorme doesn't simply read Ingersoll's speeches, but he masterfully performs them. Ted brings Ingersoll's assertiveness and wit to life in these nicely produced recordings.\n\nListening to Ted Delorme's performance, it easy to understand why Robert Ingersoll was beloved by so many of his contemporaries such as Samuel Clemens, Walt Whitman, Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, and President James Garfield.\n\nBetween 1865 and 1899, Ingersoll crisscrossed America on more than a dozen speaking tours. He packed the largest theaters of the day at the then-substantial admission of $1 apiece. \n\nThanks to LibriVox and Ted Delorme, everyone can now hear and experience the speeches of Robert Ingersoll without a time machine and a ticket.","reviewtitle":"The Way Ingersoll Was Meant To Be Heard!","reviewer":"John Kurz","reviewdate":"2009-11-29 20:14:18","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This narration is not only consisting of material that is infinitely interesting but Ted Delorme makes it enjoyable to the point where it can be listened to many times over without ever getting bored. He does such a good job of putting passion and inflection into the reading of Colonel Ingersoll, that after listening to this many times over, I'm CONVINCED that I am hearing an actual recording of the man himself. I'm instantly transported to the late 1800's by his voice and my imagination creates the rest. I can't imagine someone doing a better job.\n\nWow. just spectacular, Ted. I can't thank you enough for your efforts. This is by far my favorite AND most listened to item on Internet Archive PERIOD, and that's to Mr. Delorme's credit. ..... And that includes my beloved Grateful Dead.","reviewtitle":"Incredible Narration","reviewer":"TheGreatAgnostic","reviewdate":"2012-01-17 00:13:40","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Anyone interested in a couple of canceled checks from 1881 \none is for $3000.00 and took 2 banks to cash it.The other is for $30.00.

Felt like I was listening to Robert Ingersoll himself! Thanks Ted!","reviewtitle":"Incredible!","reviewer":"Woodchuck111","reviewdate":"2013-03-06 02:44:26","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"\"Humans must have a distinction of what we can know and what we must believe\" ~David Hume\n\n\"When it comes to a god all we're left with is a kind of leap of faith, which leaves reason and knowledge behind.\"  ~David Hume\n\nR.G. Ingersoll and Christopher Hitchens are primarily responsible for helping me to stand up, head held high and proclaim my independence from the intuitive zombie-like behavior I was taught as a child and believed as a young man, I put away those childish things you could say. It is amazing how much I Did Not know about religion and by researching, not just the anti-theist view but theology, eschatology, ecclesiastics, etc... I found myself at a point of anger and frustration that most of what is in the bible (New\/Old Test.)was never mentioned or taught to us growing up in a catholic family and going to catholic school until the 8th grade. What of those who know the bible inside\/out, can they be so deceived?  This god of the bible is not a merciful\/loving god, he's some sort of twisted nefarious tyrant with \"folded arms\"(Hitchens) and what's more; Does Not ...exsist.  We cannot but choose otherwise because science continues to tell us so. Use the analytical and tell yourself the Truth!  It becomes very clear once you begin to chip away at the text.  \n\n\n","reviewtitle":"Freedom From All Religion ...Now!","reviewer":"PlanetPeace","reviewdate":"2013-03-13 06:36:30","stars":"5"}]},
