His works are notable for their mimetic and sensual style and include sonnets, love poetry, religious poems,  Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially as compared to that of his contemporaries.
