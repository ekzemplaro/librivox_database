Service. <br \/> Read in English by Phil Benson<br \/><br \/> Reputedly the best-selling poetry collection of the 20th century, 'Songs of a Sourdough' is best known for Robert W. Service's classic Yukon ballads, 'The Shooting of Dan McGrew' and 'The Cremation of Sam McGhee'. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, and grew up in Scotland. In his twenties, he made his way to Canada and settled in the Yukon where he worked as a bank clerk but evidently dreamed of more adventurous pursuits. Service's readings of his poems show that he could adopt either a Scottish or North American accent. Here they are read in an accent that is not too far removed from the place of his birth. - Summary by Phil Benson<br \/><br \/> For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/songs-of-a-sourdough-by-robert-w-service\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.<br \/><br \/> For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1b\/songsofasourdough_1310.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (40MB)<\/a>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"mediatype":["audio"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks;poetry; adventure; Lancashire; Yukon"],"title":["Songs of a Sourdough"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"],"publicdate":["2013-10-09 23:10:14"],"addeddate":["2013-10-09 23:10:14"],"year":["2013"],"boxid":["OL100020412"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"],"runtime":["1:27:57"]},
