In Chekhov's Russia, marriage was a means of economic stability for most people. They married to gain wealth and possessions. In this play, the concept of marriage is being satirized to show the real purpose of marriage - materialistic gain rather than true love.

The humor certainly comes through.) Consistently well acted, very much like a stage performance, which is especially delightful particularly as I suspect the actors did separate records in different times and different places to be later edited together. If so, the technical side of things deserves a big applause too!\n\nEach of the actors held his own and did not go over the top. The men were quite amazing in their interactions. The perspective \"couple\" were an excellent match, both the characters and the actors. I'm so delighted! It's well worth several consecutive listens!\n\nWow! This is an exception recording of an excellent play by Chekhov. Good work the crew of you.","reviewtitle":"Excellent!","reviewer":"Cloud Mountain","reviewdate":"2009-09-07 18:12:29","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Download and watch the new movie The Proposal http:\/\/blog-movie.com\/The-Proposal.html","reviewtitle":"Download The Proposal","reviewer":"myid38","reviewdate":"2009-10-13 04:38:23","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I found the acting a bit over the top, but it worked -- the play is very silly and fast-paced.
