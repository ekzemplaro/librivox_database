Smith.\n\nCaptain Karl von Schenk of the Kaiser's Navy is a stereotypical German nobleman - supremely self-confident, touchy about the divisions of class and any infringement on his place. He thinks he is handsome, has a suitably manly physique, an excellent singing voice, and a facility with writing. His wartime service related in his diary is a series of triumphs over harrowing circumstances, bringing his boat back in spite of the best efforts of the Royal Navy to stop him.\n\nHis one vulnerability is a young lady he meets on leave in Bruges, Belgium. Although she is the trophy girlfriend of a German colonel who could cause him much harm if he were to find out, von Schenk pursues his Zoe with Teutonic straightforwardness. And both he and the reader are entirely blind-sided by the unexpected thunderclap that puts an end to the sweet affair.\n\nStephen King-Hall, a Royal Navy officer during the war and writing as \"Etienne\", penned this book as if he had simply discovered it on a surrendered submarine. In fact, some editions of the book list the author as \"anonymous.\" King-Hall's knowlege of naval affairs lend authority to this yarn of men that go to the sea in ships that sink... on purpose.  (Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/diary-of-a-u-boat-commander-by-sir-stephen-king-hall\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks3\/DiaryOfAU-boatCommander.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (148MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2008-03-26"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["Librivox; audiobook; war; u-boat; WWI"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-03-27 00:55:18"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-03-27 00:58:39","2008-03-27 02:58:07","2011-07-08 09:12:29"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"runtime":["5:21:47"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140323074334[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020416"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":4,"avg_rating":"4.75"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I'm an older person (age 71) who spent 6 years in the Navy in peacetime serving on a Minesweeper.  But anyone who has been on the sea for any length of time can identify with this tale of war, unrequited love and incredible suspense.  The horror of World War I naval warfare is front and center, and young lives lost in the senseless slaughter of wartime.....well, what can you say?  The story starts slowly, and sounds like a real diary, and it begins to grip you as you proceed through the book.  It is a book you will long remember.  The narrator is Mark Smith of Simpsonson, South Carolina whose mellow voice is simply captivating.  You should seek out his other recordings.  Trust me on this, you will enjoy this book, and you will never forget it.","reviewtitle":"This is a fabulous book","reviewer":"Showbizbuff","reviewdate":"2009-10-23 00:02:11","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I'm a new fan of Mark Smith's reading - he does an excellent job. This tale gives interesting insight on the U-boat war, and its interesting to see how the events of the war affect Karl's ego and views of the English as the tale goes on.","reviewtitle":"Well read story","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2010-04-08 17:17:40","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This is an epic tale, read by Mark Smith. Mr. Smith's voice adds to the story, a depth of feeling, which allows the listener to feel as if they are reading this true tale themselves. I found myself very intrigued by the narration and the tale itself. I highly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the historical significance of WWI, ond\/or the history of submarine warfare.","reviewtitle":"Diary of a U-Boat Commander (Mark Smith)","reviewer":"1dannyo","reviewdate":"2013-01-15 04:40:04","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Dittos to all the great comments below.
