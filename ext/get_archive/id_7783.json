I think that our people at Home will be glad to know more, and ought to know more, of what these bald phrases may actually signify, when, in the other sense, we read 'between the lines.' (Summary by Boyd Cable) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"paste%20or%20type%20link%20to%20LV%20catalog%20page%20here\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks2\/BetweenTheLines.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (160MB)<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2013-06-12"],"year":["2013"],"subject":["World War I; The Great War; British Army; Trench Warfare; librivox; audiobook"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140323075211[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020105"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"One of the great things about LibriVox is that it enables a talented reader to engage with a book and give a truly individual performance that brings the text alive and does honour to it.\n\nDelmar H Dolbier is one such reader and I salute him.  He has the vocal polish and assured delivery of a professional, but the wholehearted commitment of an amateur in the best sense.  This is no mediocre, measured account that 'lets the words speak for themselves' - what a daft meaningless phrase, forsooth! His is a full-throated realisation of a text that documents the blood and guts of human experience.  Again bravo!","reviewtitle":"Bravo the reader","reviewer":"vox humana","reviewdate":"2013-06-16 17:58:14","stars":"5"}]},
