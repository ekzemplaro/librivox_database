"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":4,"avg_rating":"4.75"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This story was my first introduction to the Solomon Kane character, and what a great pulpy dark story it is. The protagonist comes across an dying maiden who he doesn't know and is thrown into an adventurer that crosses continents.\n\nWhat I found amazing in this short story is that it remained a short story. In a mere sentence or two great swathes of the chase are hinted at, great literay moments that have just been bypassed.\n\nDespite the hinted at \"missing\" sections the story does not let up and speeds along at a pace that will keep you listening.\n\nThe hero is just that, a man with a sword on a goodly quest. If you like a pulp story then this is something your going to like. The reader has a great deep voice that lends weight to the telling.\n\nFor more of my reviews of free audio visit http:\/\/freeaudioreview.blogspot.com\/","reviewtitle":"Free Audio Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2009-02-02 00:00:49","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is a story full of slashing swords and purple prose. Howard is one of the better pulp fiction magazine writers and his stories crackle with action. This story, and those like it, are one of my favorite literary guilty pleasures.\nFor full review and others, visit http:\/\/www.freelistens.blogspot.com","reviewtitle":"Free Listens review","reviewer":"Sayeth","reviewdate":"2010-07-09 12:13:16","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"It seems kind of abrupt.  \n\nSolomon Kane is a puritan avenger (bit of an irony IMHO) who slays the evil to protect the innocent.  The story also hints that forces beyond the everyday assist him in his quest.  \n\nThe reader is excellent and does a great job with voices.  I just found the story a bit abrupt, but still a good read.","reviewtitle":"Not sure about this story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-07-15 16:13:47","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"I hope all REH's stories will appear in audio form.\nArchive.org has a whole bunch of his stories read by computer.\nhttp:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/RobertEHowardPublicDomainAudio2\nBut I like human voices better. I hope FNH will find the time to read some of the REH stories.\nAll his other readings are of the highest quality.\nMy compliments,\nRoland\nfrom the Netherlands","reviewtitle":"The Great Pulp Fiction of REH","reviewer":"Roland Wieffering","reviewdate":"2010-11-29 13:28:46","stars":"5"}]},
