Read by Ruth Golding.\n\n<i>A House to Let<\/i> is a novella originally published in 1858 in the Christmas edition of Dickens' <i>Household Words<\/i> magazine. Each of the contributors wrote a chapter (stories within a story, and in the case of Adelaide Anne Procter, as a story in verse) and the whole was edited by Dickens. \n\nThe plot concerns an elderly woman, Sophonisba, who notices signs of life in a supposedly empty dilapidated house (the eponymous \"House to Let\") opposite her own, and employs the efforts of an elderly admirer, Jabez Jarber, and her servant, Trottle, to discover what is happening within. (Summary by Ruth Golding and Wikipedia)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-house-to-let-by-charles-dickens-and-others\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks2\/HouseToLet-48kb.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (88MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2009-01-31"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["mystery; fiction; short stories; librivox; literature; audiobook"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-01-31 14:38:10"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-01-31 14:59:22","2010-05-21 05:49:49","2010-05-21 05:50:52"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140320170020[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020109"]},

You don't quite know where the next chapter is going to take you.\n\nRuth does an excellent job reading this solo project - she's so easy to listen to, and so subtly expressive.","reviewtitle":"Delightful collaboration","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2010-04-28 13:05:58","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This book is a collaboration of stories joined together by the main character.  Each section has a different author, and the styles of writing change from section to section.  I think that is why I wasn't as pleased by this story as the other reviewers were.  \n\nSome of the sections were difficult to follow, others were excellent.  Overall, this is an okay book.  \n\nThe reader was excellent and has a great reading voice.  She did a nice job.  I just found the story difficult to get into.","reviewtitle":"Mixed review","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-07-29 15:25:53","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"Having partaken in a similar writing project, I know that it's no mean feat to take on a story where somebody else has let off. I think it is nicely done.\n\nRuth Golding does a perfect job at bringing it to life.","reviewtitle":"Neat little story","reviewer":"Teutonic girl","reviewdate":"2014-05-09 08:26:18","stars":"4"}]},
