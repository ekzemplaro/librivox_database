"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":8,"avg_rating":"4.13"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Although she has a very pleasant speaking voice, she needs to breath between words.  She goes so fast that you can't follow it.  Good God woman, BREATHE!","reviewtitle":"Ruined Reading Impossible to listen to","reviewer":"thecrwth","reviewdate":"2007-12-16 03:52:37","stars":"1"},{"reviewbody":"Very good English accented reading of this classic. A bit fast, however, which is why I give it 4 stars. Karen's readings are great. I recommend listeners search for her name here and at Librivox.org   If you're reading this, thanks Karen for much listening pleasure.","reviewtitle":"A very fine reading","reviewer":"TheBookworm","reviewdate":"2007-12-19 23:16:50","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Very nicely read, Karen.  Keep up the good work!","reviewtitle":"Excellent stuff...","reviewer":"AvidListener","reviewdate":"2007-12-19 23:34:01","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Oh my goodness! How can you say she was a terrible reader! Karen is one of my all time favorites! She does all the accents terrifically well. I totally enjoyed her reading of this lovely story. Thanks Karen!","reviewtitle":"Amazing reader!!","reviewer":"Starlite001","reviewdate":"2007-12-20 00:01:56","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Nice voice and accent.  However, the reading was too fast to be thoroughly enjoyable.  There doesn't seem to be any time to think about the story along the way--only enough time to listen and keep up.","reviewtitle":"The Story of the Treasure Seekers","reviewer":"NicLynn","reviewdate":"2009-02-04 22:18:17","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"This is a wonderful book for all ages, but especially children. I loved it (I love all Nesbit books) but it was read slightly to fast. Beautiful voice and emotion,and I love the accent, but to fast. That is the only thing wrong with it at all. Very much recommended!","reviewtitle":"LOVE Nesbit","reviewer":"laurie23","reviewdate":"2011-03-06 00:59:39","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Karen Savage does a superb job of capturing the exuberant voice of the narrator, someone I imagine as being a young girl, although in fact it might be a boy: the narrator leaves that for us to figure out. Be that as it may, I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Karen at reading this. I found the energetic reading enthralling.\n\nThose who think the book is read too fast wouldn't fare very well at an original performance of a Shakespeare play, for they spoke very quickly back in the day.\n\nIsn't there something terribly mean-spirited about giving someone who generously volunteered their time a one star rating? It seems so to me. I can't say that you won't think it's read too fast; I can only say that I don't think it is. NicLynn's three star rating is reasonable. \n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite Librivox readings.","reviewtitle":"Love the Performance. Delightful. Did Lots of Smiling.","reviewer":"Donald R Miller","reviewdate":"2013-11-21 12:00:29","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Another book by the wonderful Edith Nesbit superbly read by the wonderful Karen Savage.\n\nI highly recommend K.S.'s reading of E.N.'s *The Railway Children*. I'd like it if she could do all of Mrs. Nesbit's books.  She reads them perfectly.","reviewtitle":"It's great!","reviewer":"lanternland","reviewdate":"2014-06-27 07:17:18","stars":"5"}]},
