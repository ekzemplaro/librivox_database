In it, Twain explains, complains about, and shows how one might improve upon various aspects of the (awful) German language. His examples of precisely how the German language is awful include the famed \u201cseparable verb\u201d \u2013 which allows one to put the first part of a given verb at the beginning \u2013 and its second part at the end \u2013 of a given clause or sentence (which may, indeed, be very long). He also makes fun of the extreme length of certain compound nouns (which are created by tacking two \u2013 or more \u2013 words together, without using hyphens to clarify where one ends and the next begins), as well as the many noun and verb forms one must master (memorize) in order to use German cases properly.\nAs the essay progresses, Twain includes a few hilarious passages that are partly or mostly in (his own, awful) German. Nevertheless, the work is easily understandable even by people who don\u2019t know any German at all.\n(In the novel, A Tramp Abroad, Twain details his journey with his friend, Harris, through Germany, the Alps, and Italy, where he encounters various ridiculous situations. Here, much of the humor lies in his silly, often over-stated characterization of the circumstances as quickly grasped and easily explained by such a seasoned tourist as himself, while he also make plain throughout the profoundly strange nature of many of his experiences, and the various pitfalls he and Harris run into as they try to navigate their unfamiliar terrain.) (Introduction by Kirsten Wever) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-awful-german-language-by-mark-twain-v-3\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2011-06-12"],"year":["2011"],"subject":["Humor; languages; travel; essay; Samuel Clemens; Librivox; audiobook"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2011-06-12 22:20:42"],"addeddate":["2011-06-12 22:11:13"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2011-06-13 00:56:10","2011-06-19 10:34:23"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140323082916[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020312"]},
