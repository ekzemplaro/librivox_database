G. Wodehouse and C. H. Bovill. \nRead by Tim Bulkeley. \n\nA Man of Means is a collection of six short stories written in collaboration by P. G. Wodehouse and C. H. Bovill. The stories all star Roland Bleke, a nondescript young man to whom financial success comes through a series of \"lucky\" chances, the first from a win in a sweepstake he had forgotten entering. Roland, like many a timid young man seeks love and marriage. In this pursuit his wealth is regularly a mixed blessing. The plot of each story follows its predecessor, sometimes directly, and occasionally refer back to past events in Bleke's meteoric career. The writing style is crisp and droll, and shows much of the skill and polish of the later Wodehouse. The disasters that befall the hapless Bleke are entertainingly recounted and his unforeseen rescues surprise and delight. In the character of the butler, Mr Teal, we meet an early draft of the ingenious Jeeves. The stories first appeared in the United Kingdom in The Strand in 1914, and in the United States in Pictorial Review in 1916. They were later published in book form in the UK by Porpoise Books in 1991; the collection was released on Project Gutenberg in 2003.

The hero is a gentleman who can't seem to catch a break, but fate keeps making him richer.  Maybe he needs to get some backbone.  :-)  Anyways, the stories are cute, just the last one ends kind of badly for our hero.  I would have like to know what happened after that.\n\nReader was good.","reviewtitle":"Okay book","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2009-10-30 19:33:43","stars":"4"}]},
