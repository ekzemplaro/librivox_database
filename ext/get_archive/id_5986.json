FINN, S.J.. Read by Maria Therese.\n\nThe scene of the story is laid partly in Milwaukee, partly in New York. It describes the trials of the orphaned Lachance children. The boy hero is of a loving and lovable disposition and wins the hearts of all. The author has combined pathetic incidents with religious consolations, and gives zest to the whole by diffusing his genial humor throughout.\n\nFrom the author of Tom Playfair, Percy Wynn, But Thy Love and thy Grace, and many more. (Summary from Dominicana Magazine, 1900)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/his-first-and-last-appearance-by-francis-j-finn\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2012-02-27"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; fiction; Catholic; children; music; orphans"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2012-02-27 16:39:04"],"addeddate":["2012-02-27 16:22:19"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2012-02-27 18:36:49"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"]},
