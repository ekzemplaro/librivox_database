Read by Pete Williams, Pittsburgh, PA\n\nHymns to the Night\" is the last published work of Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772-1801), the German philosopher and early Romantic poet whose pen name was simply \u201cNovalis\u201d. The work alternates poetry and prose, exploring a personal mythology of darkness and light, but it is also a free-associative chronicle of a young man rationalizing the untimely death of his fianc\u00e9. This version (1897) was translated by influential fantasy author and novelist George MacDonald, who cited it as a great \u2013 and early \u2013 inspiration. \"Hymns to the Night\" is also available to Librivox listeners in the original German.

Therefore, light and day and all of their distractions are less impressive, to the author, than night. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read a more interesting description of an author craving death, and I\u2019ve read my share of emo poetry. Highly recommended for those who like poetry, but to be taken a piece at a time, rather than the entire collection at once, as the motifs become repetitive.","reviewtitle":"An excellent read of interesting poetry","reviewer":"Timothy Ferguson","reviewdate":"2013-04-03 13:24:24","stars":"4"}]},
