Omar's Rubaiyat is a beautiful anthology of Islamic wisdom literature: originally penned in medieval Persian during the late 11th century AD. <\/p><p>The best known English translations are those by Edward Fitzgerald: his fifth (and last) translation includes a mere 101 quatrains - a fraction of Omar's original work. Fitzgerald's selection loosely groups quatrains by theme; rendering quatrains into English as four-line, rhymed stanzas. <\/p><p>Omar's writings are pervaded by the consciousness of the transient quality of life. In his Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, the author ponders the limits of human knowledge and morality: and confronts his readers point-blank with the difficult questions that challenge every generation: <\/p><br \/>- what is the ultimate benefit derived from human knowledge? <br \/>- given human mortality; is is best to guide our lives by the dictates of reason, or sensuality? <br \/>- what happens to my soul when I die? <br \/>- why did God - the Creator - give me existence? <br \/><p>(Introduction by Godsend)<\/p>\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2010-09-26"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; omar khayy\u00e1m; omar khayyam; philosophy; poetry; quatrains"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/3.0\/"],"publicdate":["2010-09-25 20:36:30"],"addeddate":["2010-09-25 20:32:39"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-09-26 12:27:25","2010-09-26 14:11:46","2010-09-26 14:12:34","2010-09-26 14:13:12","2010-09-26 14:13:53","2010-09-26 14:14:16","2010-09-26 17:58:26","2010-09-26 17:59:08","2010-09-26 18:04:04","2010-09-26 18:05:35"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
