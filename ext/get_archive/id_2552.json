When he was captured behind enemy lines, the book was still a work in progress. The Armistice would not be reached until November of that year.\n\n    Although he does not mention it in this book, Mr. Hall had already served the better part of 15 months with the British Expeditionary Forces, surviving the battle of Loos in Sept \u2013 Oct 1915, and upon which his excellent work \u201cKitchener\u2019s\u201d Mob is Based.\n\n    The US did not enter the war until April 1917, and Hall had already served nearly three years as an American with British and French forces, as a machine gunner with the British, and as a pilot in the Lafayette Escadrille.\n\n    Pilot training in the French Air Corps was primarily a matter of survival. Visualize if you will, a class of \u201cPenguins\u201d, aircraft with wings too short for flight scurrying about the airfield as student pilots learn to control these machines with no instructor on board, and for that matter in Mr. Halls case there was never an instructor on board. Their solo flight was their first flight. They learned by doing.\n\n    The sheer joy and wonder of man\u2019s early experience of leaving the bounds of Earth in an aircraft coupled with the danger and excitement of air combat made \u201cHigh Adventure\u201d such a good read, I completed the narration ahead of schedule, because I couldn\u2019t put it down.

Hall, an American, served in a French squadron, so he had better equipment than his countrymen (who, as Richenbacker in the previous book complains, were given neither modern machines or parachutes).\n\nHis book is structurally odd, as it was published before the conclusion of the war: its final chapter is a letter written by Hall from a POW camp. Its self-effacing humor reminds me most of Vet in a Spin by James Herriot. Recommended to those interested in military history of the period, and those who like autobiographies generally.\n\n","reviewtitle":"An excellent book","reviewer":"Timothy Ferguson","reviewdate":"2013-10-03 02:14:04","stars":"5"}]},
