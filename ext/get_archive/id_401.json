This was a time of widespread social disturbance, as the preamble describes; the Act sought to put an end to this. A group of twelve or more people, \u201cbeing unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled\u201d, would be read a proclamation; they must disperse within an hour, on pain of death. The same fate would befall anyone preventing the reading of the proclamation, or damaging buildings while on a riot. If the law enforcement officers happened to injure or kill a rioter, they were immune from prosecution. The reading of the proclamation, the wording of which is detailed in the Act, was the necessary first step before action could be taken against the rioters. This gave us the phrase \u201cto read the riot act\u201d, to give a stern warning or rebuke. The Act was repealed in Britain in 1973, but had long since fallen into disuse there. A version is still in force in Canada. \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-riot-act-by-british-parliament\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>. \n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks3\/RiotAct.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"publicdate":["2006-05-06 08:27:26"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2011-04-28 02:01:10"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"],"date":["2006-05-06"],"year":["2006"],"subject":["LibriVox; audiobook"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140320152516[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020105"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},
