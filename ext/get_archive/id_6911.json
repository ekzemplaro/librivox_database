The date: May 23, 1913. The weekday, attendance is light; the attendees are scattered between two floors. Suddenly a cry rings out from the second floor. Scrambling to Section II, the museum director discovers a teenage girl dead with an arrow through her heart. An older woman hovers over her whispering incoherent phrases in the girl's ear and offering incomprehensible answers to the director's questions. She is the only witness to the crime, or accident, as the case may be. How will the feeble, 83 year-old Mr. Gryce unravel this mystery when this witness is apparently insane?\n\nAnna Katharine Green was noted for her scientific approach to the murder mystery. In The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow she breaks more ground with her in-depth study of the psychological interplay between the murderer, the victim and the witnesses. Although more quietly paced, this mystery presents many elements of a current psychological thriller: blind ambition, narcissism, obsession and betrayal. Green adds a peculiar twist with the fact that two heartbroken relatives of the victim sacrifice virtually everything to protect the murderer.(Summary girlbooks\/blog.com)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-mystery-of-the-hasty-arrow-by-anna-katharine-green\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-09-13"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; fiction; mystery"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"]},

Who is she, and why was she killed?  Why did her mother flee in terror after she died?  \n\nThis is a wonderful story, full of human interest and mystery.  You kind of figure out the plot twist, but the ending is still a bit unexpected in how it works out.  I enjoyed it, but it sure is a sad tale of how foolish humans can be sometimes.  \n\nReader did his usual fine job.  Thank you!\n","reviewtitle":"Heartbreaking story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2012-10-05 17:13:40","stars":"4"}]},
