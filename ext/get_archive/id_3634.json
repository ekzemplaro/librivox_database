Who was the culprit and will finding out finally put an end to the mystery?

The reader has a very unique accent that lends a haunting quality to the story.  I think this same reader might have read on the Woman in White.  She is very good and her accent is quite charming.  I highly recommend this reader record all the Wilke Collins stories!  Thank you Gehinde for your work on this recording.","reviewtitle":"Great reader and story","reviewer":"benefitsingers","reviewdate":"2010-04-22 18:55:33","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is a good book and a very good reader BUT (sorry) it is spoiled by all the scratchy S sounds.  I think the reader is too close to the mic or has a mic inadequate for the purpose.  Please try it again for us...\n\n\n@Alamedared likes to follow my reviews by giving 5 stars to anything that I don't.  She tells me, suggesting duct tape, to say nothing if not Nice. Alamedared once changed Alamedared's stars just to spite me. That's not honest or helpful to anyone.  I, too, appreciate and encourage volunteers, a point Alamedared seems incapable of understanding.  My point is that it is ALSO good for the readers to have honest reviews that help readers choose pieces and that helps encourage better pieces. I like to help readers support their good effort by being careful with mics, checking pronunciations, choosing books appropriate to their voices, sex and dialects. I think that's useful to all and I volunteer to do that.  Otherwise, \"reviews\" would all be the same, as are Alamedared's, thanking volunteers (without any useful analysis) and giving 5 stars for everything. Hey, Alamedared, stop mis-using this site as a petulant game you want to play against me; this is reserved for helpful reviews of the piece. I will never change my honest, useful reviews just because you spew vitriol.","reviewtitle":"Very Good Effort Spoiled by Bad Mic","reviewer":"Sorker","reviewdate":"2010-05-16 22:31:15","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"love the reader and the story.  kudos to librivox and all the hard working volunteers!  i have been reading a lot more picky 'reviews' lately, but carry on, readers. you do the best you can and thank you for exposing us to gems just like this one.a thousand thank you's and don't let the debbie or donny downers get to you.","reviewtitle":"delicious","reviewer":"alamedared","reviewdate":"2010-05-12 05:11:09","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"The story kept me listening closely, replaying chapters to make sure I got it all, but I found the ending of the story somewhat unsatisfying.  \n\nAgnes is jilted by her fianc\u00e9e, who marries a different woman who is of questionable repute.  When the man dies unexpectedly, his family is mysteriously drawn towards Venice, where he died.  Mysterious happenings ensue.  \n\nThe reader's voice was lovely; she has a soft yet expressive way of reading.   No complaints there, Just found the ending a tad disappointing.","reviewtitle":"Eh, could have been better","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-07-02 00:00:19","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"I enjoyed it.  The narrator and story line were nicely done with a complete ending - hint: the butler did not do it.","reviewtitle":"An absorbing yarn...","reviewer":"RM_115","reviewdate":"2010-07-02 15:49:18","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"It seems that many Wilkie Collins' mysteries have a dark side, and this is no exception.  This is shorter than some of his other works, and for that reason I found it not so tedious as some of his other works. If you enjoy Collins' mysteries, then I would recommend this one as well. But recognize going in that it is subtle and not flashy. No detective racing around to find the murderer here - instead, it's a slow build to an ending twist that surprised me.\n\nI thought the reading was clear and good. Kehinde has an American accent, but I'm guessing she is not a native speaker because some of the pronunciations were off. Nothing to detract from the story, and there is soft, ethereal quality to her voice that adds to the mystery.","reviewtitle":"Enjoyable Collins Mystery","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2010-08-02 17:04:10","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"to avert our eyes from summeries and reviews.
