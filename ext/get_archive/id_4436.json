Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness.\nSo one day, \u2019twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the year, the weather was so wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all sat round the fire, busy with this thing and that. But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the window-pane. Then the father went out to see what was the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what should he see but a great big White Bear.\n\u201cGood-evening to you!\u201d said the White Bear.\n\u201cThe same to you!\u201d said the man.\n\u201cWill you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I\u2019ll make you as rich as you are now poor,\u201d said the Bear. (from the book)\n\nThis collection of old Scandinavian fairy tales will enchant you with stories of trolls, enchanted castles, princesses and a White Bear (summary by Nadine)\n\nFor more information, or to volunteer, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2010-11-19"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["Audiobook; LibriVox; Scandinavia; fairy tales; trolls; white bear; princess; Norway; Norwegian; Asbj\u00f8rnsen; Moe"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2010-11-19 17:26:57"],"addeddate":["2010-11-19 17:04:46"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-11-19 18:09:03","2010-11-19 18:10:12","2010-11-19 18:30:03","2010-11-19 18:30:58","2010-11-19 18:31:22","2010-11-19 18:33:40","2010-11-20 03:39:37"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
