It also predicts some very near real technology, super capacitors!\nThis work of fiction is frighteningly close to the reality, only instead of \"treason\" its \"terrorism\" and the situation is getting worse. \n\nJust remember,\n\n\"Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\" -Benjamin Franklin\n\n\nBy the way-Gregg Margarite and Mark Nelson both occupy the #1 reader position in my book!\n\nPeace","reviewtitle":"Eerily Predictive for 1953!","reviewer":"Pyrodin123321","reviewdate":"2010-08-02 21:19:25","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is another 'big brother' type of story where people sacrifice creativity for safety.
