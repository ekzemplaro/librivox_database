Read by Nicholas Clifford. \n\n\"The Jolly Corner,\" published in 1908, is considered by many to be a ghost story ranking second only to \"The Turn of the Screw.\" James\u2019s protagonist, Spencer Brydon, is an American of 56, returned to New York after 33 years in Europe, where he has apparently accomplished little while living off his New York rentals. His friendship with Alice Staverton, and his engagement in the development of a property awaken him to the possibilities that might have been his, had he chosen a different course of life. The \"ghost,\" if that\u2019s what it is, is that other self that might have been, and his confrontation with that self and its possibilities leads to a deeply unsettling, yet ambiguous, conclusion.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-jolly-corner-by-henry-james\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks4\/JollyCorner_64kb.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (44MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2009-08-10"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["Librivox; audiobook; literature; James; ghost story; New York"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-08-09 19:46:37"],"addeddate":["2009-08-09 19:34:34"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-08-09 20:25:28","2010-11-23 04:31:19"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140320190721[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020215"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},

On the surface a ghost story, it is really a story about the ghosts which haunt our own interiors. It poses deep existential questions--Who are we, really? Would we even recognize ourselves in a life in which in which we had made different choices? What does it mean to love someone regardless of how that person develops over the course of a lifetime?\nWell-read. Highly recommended.","reviewtitle":"Haunted by our own demons...","reviewer":"Kydiana","reviewdate":"2010-01-19 05:25:04","stars":"5"}]},
