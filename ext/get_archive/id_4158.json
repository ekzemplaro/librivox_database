"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.67"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I'd love to see this story expanded on and made into a movie.\n\nRastignac is part of a group of humans that are controlled by living skins that they wear like clothing.  Ew.  Anyways, he along with others decide they are tired of being controlled and they stage a revolt.  The story ends abruptly, so you might feel a bit unsatisfied with the ending, but the concept is cool and so is the storyline.\n\nReader is very good.  Easy to understand and nice mellow voice.  I also grinningly mention that his style of reading is reminiscent of James T Kirk.  :-)  Hope to hear more books with him reading!","reviewtitle":"Neat if a bit short story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-05-12 15:51:47","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Skins, a new way to rule the world?
