Read by Dave7.\n\nFrancis de Sales (1567-1622) was a French priest and later bishop of Geneva who was revered as a master of spiritual direction and fondly remembered for his keen insights into the personal spiritual struggles of men and women of all faiths. His Introduction to the Devout Life, which he wrote especially for laypersons, and his Treatise on the Love of God remain fundamental reading for all earthly pilgrims who seek personal moral improvement and strive for spiritual perfection.\n\nPere Huguet has gathered together in this one volume some of the most poignant insights of Saint Francis de Sales and has organized them by subject matter into eighty-four concise chapters. These time-honored, spiritual gems have brought comfort to many a weary heart, have renewed and energized discouraged souls, and have guided generations of spiritual travelers along the way to everlasting peace and life.
