Pretty, young Ellie Fenwick is walking to the market early one morning to surprise her father with some fresh mushrooms. As she passes a gambling house, she hears a gunshot and two young men emerge. One man falls dead on the pavement and the other is Johnny Montgomery, a handsome young man Ellie recognizes from seeing him previously at a dance. Johnny is holding a smoking pistol in his hand. This incident propels the proper young Ellie into a world of prisons and courtrooms as a murder trial unfolds and the fate of Johnny may rest with her testimony. But, what is the connection with the mysterious Spanish Woman, who lives in a grand house and supposedly has friends in 'high places'? Who else was in the gambling house at that time of the morning before it had opened? What about the whispered conversations between Ellie's father, Mr. Fenwick, and his friend, Mr. Bingley, a prominent attorney prosecuting the case? Things are not always what they may seem...

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.67"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"The summary does a nice job of describing the story and plot, so no extra details required.\n\nThe reader was very good, nice voice, easy to follow, and the recordings were all solid with no distracting noises.  This is a great story.  Enjoy!","reviewtitle":"Very good story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-09-29 13:40:19","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"First of all I love LeeAnn Howlett, she is a wonderful narrator and frankly I think her excellent narration kept me going through this story.  The story itself is okay, I was a bit annoyed with the characters and really felt that Elly was like shrinking violet.  Not really sure how you fall in love with someone the way she did, but maybe that is how they wrote love stories in those days.  This story will keep you interested but only because LeeAnn narrates it well to keep you listening.  Thanks for your excellent work!","reviewtitle":"Narration Excellent... story not so sure","reviewer":"benefitsingers","reviewdate":"2010-11-17 17:41:10","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This is a wonderfully engaging mystery.  It doesn't follow the usual formula, but focuses on Ellie's experiences as she must tell her story and in that process, the reader works through the mystery with her.  I don't find the romance aspect improbable - Ellie has compassion on Johnny, and he clearly wants her to do the right thing, even to his personal detriment, so she can tell quite a bit about his character from that.  Many people have fallen in love on less!\n\nLee Ann does an excellent job narrating this solo project.  And she also has an excellent studio\/mike set up - there's no distortion in her voice, no echo, and no background noise.  It's professional quality.","reviewtitle":"Engaging mystery","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2011-06-30 22:40:27","stars":"5"}]},
