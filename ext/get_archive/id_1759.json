In KSM the heroes went looking for adventure, but in this story they whisked away into adventure without any choice in the matter.\n\nThe characters are homely enough and in the usual vein of character that is honourable and good hearted. They are thrown into some horrid situations and you just know it's going to come to blows. In fact it comes to a fascinating and bloody climax!\n\nIts a long book, running to over six and a half hours, so if you have a boring Sunday in the offing this might well be worth downloading. I can just imagine curling up with this book in my ears on the sofa with snacks and drinks to hand.\n\nThe reading is okay and the sound is fine, ans all round easy listen.\n\nRead more of my reviews of the free audio I've found on the web at http:\/\/FreeAudioReview.blogspot.com\/","reviewtitle":"Free Audio Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2009-03-31 18:52:28","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"They seem to be saved by friendly strangers a few too many times, and bears are psychopathic killing machines in this book.
