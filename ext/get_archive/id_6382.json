Read by David Wales.\n\nRICHARD HARDING DAVIS, as a friend and fellow author has written of him, was \u201cyouth incarnate,\u201d and there is probably nothing that he wrote of which a boy would not some day come to feel the appeal. But there are certain of his stories that go with especial directness to a boy\u2019s heart and sympathies and make for him quite unforgettable literature. A few of these were made some years ago into a volume, \u201cStories for Boys,\u201d and found a large and enthusiastic special public in addition to Davis\u2019s general readers; and the present collection from stories more recently published is issued with the same motive. This book takes its title from \u201cThe Boy Scout,\u201d the first of its tales; and it includes \u201cThe Boy Who Cried Wolf,\u201d \u201cBlood Will Tell,\u201d the immortal \u201cGallegher,\u201d and \u201cThe Bar Sinister,\u201d Davis\u2019s famous dog story. It is a fresh volume added to what Augustus Thomas calls \u201csafe stuff to give to a young fellow who likes to take off his hat and dilate his nostrils and feel the wind in his face.\u201d (Summary by Publisher's Note in book)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-boy-scout-and-other-stories-for-boys-by-richard-harding-davis\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-03-02"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["LibriVox; audiobook; short stories; fiction; Boy Scout; newspaper reporting; spy; dogs; Cuba"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2012-03-03 01:00:03"]},
