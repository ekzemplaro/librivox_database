He was tried, convicted, and executed, not for being a Confederate soldier, but for conspiracy and murder relating to his command of Camp Sumter, the infamous Confederate prisoner-of-war prison at Andersonville, Georgia. Wirz encouraged and commanded barbaric and murderous policies and actions in the prison. This Librivox recording is excerpts from the <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/cu31924027053184\" rel=\"nofollow\">850 page summary of the trial<\/a> written by the Army Judge Advocate (prosecutor) for, and at the command of, The Congressional House Of Representatives, 40th Congress, Second Session, Ex, Doc. No 23.  This recording omits the 614 pages of testimony by very numberous witnesses, both Federal and Confederate.  What is recorded conveys the substance of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.
