Dick\n   Read by Phil Chenevert\n\n   Aliens have invaded the earth! Horrible one celled creatures disguised as normal human beings ! Well, at least that is what it seems to the author. Yes, The Eyes Have It is a whimsical story, making gentle fun of certain writing styles, but only a topflight science-fictionist like Philip Dick , we thought, could have written this story, in just this way. Tony and the Beetles takes place far in the future when Earth's enormous colonial empire is well established but the question is, how long can it last? 10 year old Tony grows up fast when history catches up with the human race. A sobering look at human history .. and our probable future. Two very different stories but both entertaining.  (Summary by the magazine editor and Phil Chenevert) \n\n    For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-eyes-have-it-tony-and-the-beetles-by-philip-k-dick\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n    For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available in \"Science-Fiction Short Stories Anthology Vol. 1\"<\/a>"],"date":["2012-10-15"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["science fiction;philip dick;librivox;audiobook;"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140324054244[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020407"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":2,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"The first story is a study in misunderstanding and conspiracy theory, but in a funny way.  \n\nThe second story is thought-provoking. What we see here is what happens when children are introduced to prejudice based on race.  At first, they play and are friends, and then things change and the parents influence them to also change.  Innocence is lost, and the eyes are no longer color-blind.  Especially note how the viewpoint of the main character changes due to how his friends treat him. \n\nI think this is a story that schools would do well to review with their students.  It casts a light on social structure without inflaming the passions of people.  \n\nExcellent work by Phil in both reading and selection.  Thanks!","reviewtitle":"Funny and sad story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2012-10-30 23:54:43","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"that the second story would be a good way to introduce the subject of racial prejudice but it also would be a good introduction to the long term effects of colonialism and war.
