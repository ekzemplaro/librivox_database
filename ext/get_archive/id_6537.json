Not only was the darkness impenetrable, but the raw mist enveloping hill and valley made the open road anything but desirable to a belated wayfarer like myself.\n\nBeing young, untrammeled, and naturally indifferent to danger, I was not averse to adventure; and having my fortune to make, was always on the lookout for El Dorado, which, to ardent souls, lies ever beyond the next turning. Consequently, when I saw a light shimmering through the mist at my right, I resolved to make for it and the shelter it so opportunely offered.\n\nBut I did not realize then, as I do now, that shelter does not necessarily imply refuge, or I might not have undertaken this adventure with so light a heart. Yet, who knows? The impulses of an unfettered spirit lean toward daring, and youth, as I have said, seeks the strange, the unknown and, sometimes, the terrible. (Exerpt from Chapter I) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-house-in-the-mist-by-anna-katharine-green\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/Librivoxm4bCollectionAudiobooks_12\/HouseInTheMist.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (51MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2012-04-15"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; mystery; inheritance; revenge; greed"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140325205541[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020014"]},

Sigh!  \n\nThat aside, this is also a good mystery.  A man's fortune is about to be divided up between his undeserving relatives.  However, he insists on one formality - a last supper.  A weary traveler stumbles onto the scene and becomes an unwilling participant in the story that is about to unfold.  Oh and what a story!\n\nCarolin did an excellent job bringing another AKG to life.
