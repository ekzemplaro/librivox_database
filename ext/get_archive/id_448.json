Mark Twain's lively tale of the scrapes and adventures of boyhood is set in St. Petersburg, Missouri, where Tom Sawyer and his friend Huckleberry Finn have the kinds of adventures many boys can imagine: racing bugs during class, impressing girls, with fights and stunts in the schoolyard, getting lost in a cave, and playing pirates on the Mississippi river.\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n<p>To see a beautiful scan of Tom Sawyer, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/adventuresoftoms00twaiiala\" rel=\"nofollow\">this version<\/a> in our American Libraries collection.<\/p>\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/tom-sawyer-by-mark-twain\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more information or to volunteer, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of Complete Book<\/a>"],"date":["2006-05-01"],"year":["2006"],"subject":["librivox;  audiobook;  literature"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-05-01 01:15:37"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","ARossi","librivoxbooks","binderc","binderc","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-05-01 02:55:37","2006-05-01 13:43:05","2006-05-08 22:04:27","2009-09-08 18:25:08","2009-09-08 22:42:35","2010-05-23 09:38:14"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"]},
