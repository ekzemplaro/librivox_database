Lucy. Read by <a href=\"http:\/\/golding.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruth Golding<\/a>.\n\n<i>East by West: a Journey in the Recess<\/i> is an account of British journalist Henry Lucy's travels across America and on to the Far East during the parliamentary recess in 1883.\n\nLucy was one of the most influential journalists of his day and, as \"Toby M.P.\", a noted humorist in Punch magazine. His acute powers of observation and light touch make this a most engaging book. It is a fascinating insight into the Englishman's travels abroad within two decades of the American Civil War and the end of Japanese isolationism.\n\nThis is the first of two volumes covering his journey with his wife. This first volume includes his travels in America and in Japan, including the Atlantic and Pacific crossings by steamer. Volume II, which I hope to record later, continues his experiences in Japan and India, returning home via Aden and the Suez Canal. (Introduction by Ruth Golding)\n\nVolume II of this work is also available <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/east_by_west2_rg_librivox\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/east-by-west-vol-i-by-henry-w-lucy\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks_14\/EastByWesVol1.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (216MB)<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2010-06-26"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["librivox; audio book; travel; United States; USA; Japan; Atlantic; Pacific; mining; railroad; Mormon; San Francisco; Chinese; New York; Salt Lake City; Rocky Mountains; Mikado; Shogun; Yokohama; Nikko; Tokyo; tea-house; jinrickisha; Japanese theatre"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-06-26 18:38:13"],"addeddate":["2010-06-26 17:51:50"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-06-26 18:57:14","2010-06-26 18:59:07"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321044617[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020215"]},
