I kept hearing this clicking sound and gave up after the first chapter.","reviewtitle":"Annoying Clicking Sounds","reviewer":"Steve Colby","reviewdate":"2013-01-05 02:26:11","stars":"2"},{"reviewbody":"Pete Townshend of The Who wrote the above statement on the original cover of what many people, myself included, consider to be the best live album any rock band recorded. Too bad the sounds would ruin it for the previous reviewer.\n\nI like Tom Crawford's voice and his delivery, for it is what Librivox is at its community-recording best. Just an idea, but instead of complaining, a listener could always shell out some money for a professionally recorded audio book.\n\nOver the years, Librivox has been blessed with many professional or near professional quality volunteers. That's a fortunate occurrence, but one hopes that the spirit of a community effort always remains and that there is room for people who have various talents to offer.\n\nOne talent that Tom Crawford has is giving his readings the impression of authenticity.","reviewtitle":"\"Clicking Sounds Okay\" The Who \"Live at Leeds\"","reviewer":"Donald R Miller","reviewdate":"2013-11-18 04:06:24","stars":"4"}]},
