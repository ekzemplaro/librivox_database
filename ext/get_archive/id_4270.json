Read by Bellona Times.\n\n18 works -- two non-fic articles & one short fiction or poetry each -- from issues March, April, May, June, July, & August 1906 of The Scrap Book, Volume 1, edited by Frank Munsey. As he states in the editorial of the April 1906 issue (Vol 1, Iss 2) this was a sort of supplement to the editor's popular monthly, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Munsey's_Magazine\" rel=\"nofollow\">Munsey's Magazine<\/a>. The Scrap Book is very like an American version of Punch with many short, often humorous articles interspersed with at least one short story, some poetry, and several longer non-fic pieces. The Scrap Book ran up to 1922.(Summary by BellonaTimes)\n\nFor more free audio books (in over 25 languages) or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-scrap-book-volume-1-sampler-by-various\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxCollectionM4BAudiobook10\/ScrapBookSamplerVolume1_32kb.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B(149mb)<\/a>"],"date":["2010-06-02"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["LibriVox; audio book; History; Essay\/Short nonfiction"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-06-02 21:14:06"],"addeddate":["2010-06-02 20:44:22"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-06-02 21:53:45","2010-06-02 21:54:33","2010-06-03 03:23:06","2011-05-09 07:29:35"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]validator@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140407201025[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020512"]},
