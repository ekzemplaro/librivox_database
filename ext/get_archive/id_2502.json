Read by Jim Ruddy.\n\nThe Summa Theologica (or the Summa Theologiae or simply the Summa, written 1265\u20131274) is the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225\u20131274) although it was never finished. It was intended as a manual for beginners as a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasonings for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God's creation, Man, Man's purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God.(Summary adapted from the Wikipedia)\n\nThis is part two of six parts of the Prima Pars, consisting of questions regarding the Trinity and Creation.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/summa-theologica-prima-pars-trinity-and-creation-by-saint-thomas-aquinas\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2009-07-18"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; aquinas; religion"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-07-18 19:27:22"],"addeddate":["2009-07-18 18:16:44"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2009-07-18 21:30:03"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321042203[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020414"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"1.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I find this extremely offensive on many levels. The culprits in this travesty are all within the church itself--if you go to the Librivox site, you'll find a list of all the accomplices in this disgraceful display. That they chose to have the text read respectfully in all places accept where Aquinas's readers (his audience) ask questions of him says everything about the attitude of those behind this. \n\nLet's remember that the West's greatest theologian wrote this. Yet, it is totally ruined by the stunningly sarcastic way in which the reader asks the questions that Aquinas wrote in his book. It's as if the perpetrators of this disgraceful rendition are telling people like me that I'm unwelcome in their club--and that they think anyone who would ask questions is in fact an idiot. Aquinas didn't think so--that's why he wrote the book!!\n\nThis is such wasted time, and so very very wrong and immoral. If you doubt me, listen to the way the reader asks the questions that Aquinas poses. The answers and the rest of the book are read in a straight-forward manner, but the hostility towards people with questions is obvious. \n\nI had looked forward to hearing this. Indeed, I had listened to (as far as I could tolerate it) and reviewed the first section. I checked out the second half (now being months later) to see if perhaps they had realized they were making fools of themselves and had a change of heart. Nope.\n\nAbsolutely disgraceful!!!","reviewtitle":"A Mockery of Aquinas's Work and a Mocking of Those Who Wish To Hear His Work.","reviewer":"Donald R Miller","reviewdate":"2013-08-11 04:04:20","stars":"1"}]},
