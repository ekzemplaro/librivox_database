Mark Twain wrote a funny, vicious little essay on the subject, in which he states: \u201cIn one place in \u2018Deerslayer,\u2019 and in the restricted space of two-thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offences against literary art out of a possible 115.\u201d\n(Summary by Gesine)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/fenimore-coopers-literary-offenses-by-mark-twain\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nRead by <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/newcatalog\/people_public.php?peopleid=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gesine<\/a>\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; audio book; review; essay; literature; twain; cooper; deerslayer"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-12-11 05:28:43"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-12-11 14:17:18","2008-12-29 19:14:01"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"4.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Twain writes with his usual biting humor.  He clearly doesn't think much of Cooper's writing and illustrates his critique with examples that helped me to think more critically about what makes a good story.  I would recommend this short essay to all who want to understand what makes a great writer - or more accurately, what makes a popular writer not so great after all.","reviewtitle":"Enlightening critique","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2011-08-08 14:07:08","stars":"4"}]},
