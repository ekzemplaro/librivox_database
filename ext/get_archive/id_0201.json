The most recent amendment was made in the early 1970's during the Vietnam war; this amendment lowered the voting age to 18.<br \/><br \/>The first ten amendments (A.K.A. the Bill of Rights) was made by the founding fathers shortly after the actual constitution was made. The Bill of Rights covers all those things that the settlers found wrong with the rule of King George III of England. Such as: Quartering of soldiers, Freedom of speech, and Search and seizure.
