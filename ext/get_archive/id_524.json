Maude.\n\nRead by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthcallingdavid.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Barnes<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.drakesdoor.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alan Davis-Drake<\/a>\n\nAlthough Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) was a wealthy landowner, in his later life he had what was considered a \u201creligious awakening.\u201d This experience went on to inform his writing and his lifestyle in profound ways. His views transcended the specifics of religion, as known in his day - so much so he came to be a helpful guide both to Mohandas Gandhi and to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The four stories in this collection ask profound questions and gently supply helpful, non-dogmatic hints to their answerings: What is the most important thing to do? Who is the most important person? When is the most important time? What is worth owning? What is the most profound religion? What rules should men live by? How much land does a man need? Who is God? What should we bother to discuss? How should we act towards one another? How should we respond to cruelty and violence? And many more. Wonderful stories written in a relaxed style.\n\n(Summary by Alan Drake).\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"librivox.org\/what-men-live-by-and-other-tales-by-leo-tolstoy\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; literature; tolstoy; religion; religious; Russia; David Barnes; Alan Davis Drake"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-01-21 05:33:27"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2007-01-21 14:28:19","2008-08-02 02:33:16","2011-07-30 01:18:53"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
