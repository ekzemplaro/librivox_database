Conrad based the work closely on his own terrible experience in the Congo.\n\nThis work has been reinterpreted and adapted into many modern forms, the most well known being the film Apocalypse Now.\n(Summary written by Marlo Dianne)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/heart-of-darkness-by-joseph-conrad\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Librivox.org<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/heart_of_darkness\/HeartOfDarkness_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (119MB)<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; classic"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-03-11 18:19:41"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-03-11 18:23:08","2010-10-22 21:31:39"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140320170318[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020302"],"ppi":["600"],"album":["Heart of Darkness"],"artist":["Joseph Conrad"],"external-identifier":["urn:mb_releasegroup_id:5f5ca70a-3aa2-425e-8810-65caec26cc53","urn:mb_release_id:83d8520e-36de-4cd0-998b-f819f28bd00e","urn:upc:"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"],"runtime":["4:10:12"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"]},

Ms. Luoma's reading is well paced, expressive, and true to the text.  Listening to the work reveals nuances that may have escaped you when you read this one for Freshman Lit.  Highly recommended.","reviewtitle":"Worthwhile","stars":"4","reviewer":"WolfgangTheBald","reviewdate":"2007-01-08 16:17:37"},{"reviewbody":"I very much enjoyed Kristin Luoma's reading of this classic Conrad novella. Her palpable enjoyment of the narration was evident in many passages.","reviewtitle":"Wonderful Reading!","reviewer":"steadyjohn","reviewdate":"2007-09-08 23:19:43","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This story has become a classic and everyone must have heard the phrase \"the horror\" which appears to have started in this story.\n\nWe have a story that is not quite an adventure and not quite a travelogue. It falls somewhere in between. Oddly we have savages attacking the \"white men\" on a river boat but yet it never quite reaches the level of excitement that constitutes adventure.\n\nWhat we have a story that starts as a journey through the jungle and then becomes some odd kind of relationship story between the main protagonist and the mystery character \"Kurts\".\n\nI have to say that I picked up this story because of its \"classic\" branding, yet I dont really feel it lived up to that title. The story was fairly bland, the \"relationship\" was never really developed and appeared to rest on assumptions I could not fathom.\n\nSadly disapointed.\n\nReading 2\/3\nProduction 2\/3\nStory 1\/3\n\nRead more of my reviews at http:\/\/freeaudioreview.blogspot.com\/","reviewtitle":"Free Audio, Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2008-05-10 21:08:36","stars":"2"},{"reviewbody":"Conrad skillfully exposes the effects of 'advancing civilization' by raising the question of what the colonials are doing vs what they tell themselves they are doing. The question is addressed throughout, beginning in Belgium and is carried into the voyage (ship bombarding unseen enemy on the African coast). Again it is raised in the presence of the miners at the mouth of the river, and then on upstream. The book ends with a restatement of the delusion at home. What is civilization? What is barbarism? Compare the ghostly miners with the heads on the pikes. Are we different at heart? There is much more in the book, but it is hardly as trivial as reviewed below.\n\nKristin Luoma is one great reader","reviewtitle":"How are we different?","reviewer":"aimzzz","reviewdate":"2010-04-08 17:55:32","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"a review like yours is amazing don't quit your day job as a critic you would be a good bricklayer. The book and the reader were superb, fnh review not so much","reviewtitle":"fnh review","reviewer":"antwon","reviewdate":"2010-04-12 03:48:39","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"As do other thoughtful (not to say all)reviewers, I applaud Ms. Luoma's reading as well-paced and expressive, with fine enunciation and a young woman's spirit.  However, her evident talent is misapplied in this piece, in which she is cast as the voice of a soul-tormented ship's captain and other desperate male characters. I do not assume the mismatch was of her choice, that is for Librivox to determine.  Librivox readings are not mere communication of audio text; they are an art form, as much as are live theatre, cinema, and radio plays. Were this effort in one of those media, one would never expect a young woman, however talented, to be cast as the voice of the characters in this novel. \n\nThank you, Ms. Luoma; please, as would any actress, do not take my comments as sexist in any way.  I hope to have the opportunity to hear you in future, matched efforts.\n\nI was distracted by this mismatch to the point of being unable to fully appreciate the piece. \n\nAntwon's puerile ad hominem vitriol is beneath civility or interest and is here dismissed as the benthic prattle it is.","reviewtitle":"Great Talent Mismatched Here","reviewer":"Sorker","reviewdate":"2010-04-18 08:29:38","stars":"2"},{"reviewbody":"A great story poorly read.\nI read this book many years ago and loved it. I was quite disappointed in this reading. The young lady did her best but sadly her best was not good enough.","reviewtitle":"The Heart Of Darkness","reviewer":"PCSmith","reviewdate":"2012-02-15 01:08:06","stars":"1"}]},
