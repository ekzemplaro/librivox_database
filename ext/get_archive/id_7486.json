Before he left, he had boasted to his friends that he would learn the Dutch language within a fortnight. On his return, he has to admit that it wasn't quite that easy... He tells his friends stories about his clumsy attempts to speak Dutch, leading to many funny scenes. \nThis audiobook contains both \"An Irishman's difficulties with the Dutch language\" and its sequel \"Jack O'Neill's further adventures in Holland\".\n\nN.B. Audiobook read by native Dutch woman, so there is no Irish accent of the English language bits, and the Dutch is done in native Dutch pronunciation (except where the text asks for mispronunciation). (Summary by Anna Simon)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/an-irishmans-difficulties-with-the-dutch-language-by-cuey-na-gael\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks2\/IrishmansDifficultiesWithTheDutchLanguage.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (137MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2013-04-07"],"year":["2013"],"subject":["Librivox; Nederlands; audiobook; audioboek; Dutch; learning a language; humor; languages; misverstand"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"runtime":["4:59:46"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311053531[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020113"]},
