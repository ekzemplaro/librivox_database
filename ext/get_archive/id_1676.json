Sister Carrie (1900) is his first novel and tells the story of a young country girl who moves to the big city (Chicago) where she starts realizing her own American Dream by first becoming a mistress to powerful men and later as a famous actress.\n\nDreiser and his wife significantly altered the original manuscript to make it more palatable to the prevailing sensibilities of the day, but even this toned down version caused a minor scandal, and Dreiser had difficulty finding a publisher for it. This was due to the blurred division line between good and bad in the plot. Although Dreiser's moralizing narrator does assert that, despite the fame and the money she has amassed, Carrie will not be able to achieve peace of mind in her life, the apparent lack of poetic justice -- the notion that immorality should pay in the end, even if only up to a point -- was a concept the reading public were altogether unused to at the time.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"1.50"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I cannot help be blunt after suffering a dozen or so chapters with the the voice of Andera. The Voice of Andrea is quite nearly the voice of hell.  Who approved this mush-mouth to read such a brilliant work of literature?  The listening public needs SOME sort of quality control on Librivox.  There were some absolutely excellent readers in this work, then without warning comes \"The Voice of Andrea\", and she practically rendered this audiobook unlistenable.  I thought I was in the clear after a single horrible chapter, then she attacks again, finishing off the last ten or so chapters.  Please, Librivox, quality control is in order. Have mercy on listeners.","reviewtitle":"OMG","reviewer":"orpheus1925","reviewdate":"2011-01-31 10:21:23","stars":"1"},{"reviewbody":"If LibriVox were a commercial audiobook provider, we might care about \"quality control for the listeners\", but instead we are an all-volunteer website that provides \"acoustic liberation of books in the public domain\".\n\nI listened to Andrea's recording and frankly I didn't think it was that bad. Certainly not the voice I would cast as the \"voice of hell\". She has a non-Midwestern American accent (probably the New York or New Jersey area), but that's hardly sufficient reason for what you wrote.\n\nThere is a reason why we do not restrict readers according to their vocal type. Aside from the fact that we are an all-volunteer organization, and the quickest way to lose volunteers is to tell them their assistance is just not wanted, there is also the question of *whose* judgment is supposed to prevail. I've heard professionally produced, commercial audiobooks that have put me to sleep, so if commercial publishers with all their resources cannot find something to please every ear, how on earth can we as an all-volunteer organization with precious little money but what people choose to donate do any better?\n\nIf you have a problem with her reading, then by all means please record the last ten chapters of \"Sister Carrie\" and we will offer them as alternative versions on the website. We are all about \"choice of voice\" at LV.","reviewtitle":"To the reviewer below...","reviewer":"Nullifidian","reviewdate":"2011-05-10 22:38:10"},{"reviewbody":" yes Andrea is a mess!! sorry to say....i couldn't take it i decided to read the book for chapter 15, i tried to endure it but i couldn't stop myself from laughing and being annoyed. sheeesh","reviewtitle":"hahaha","reviewer":"missberry","reviewdate":"2011-05-25 19:24:56","stars":"2"}]},
