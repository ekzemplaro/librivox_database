The later novels in the series move away from Barchester itself but \u2018Barchester Towers\u2019 is very much a sequel to the first book \u2018The Warden\u2019, which is also available from Librivox.\n\nThe old bishop dies, the archdeacon, Dr. Grantly fails to succeed him and a new bishop, Dr. Proudie is appointed.

The new bishop must deal with the wardenship of Hiram\u2019s Hospital. Will it go to Mr. Harding? All is to play for. Then the old Dean dies and the stakes are raised. (Summary by Andy)\n\nMy comments:  Andy Minter is one of my favorite readers and he takes quite a few chapters in this book.  The other readers also do an excellent job, making the entire book easy to listen to.\n\nThe book is limited in locale and time, but not in characters.  Trollope spends considerable time developing interesting people to populate his little ecclesiastical world. We not only follow the various players around but we hear their thoughts and what the narrator thinks of each of them.  There's much misunderstanding, as conversations get twisted and turned in the retelling, as inferences drawn in error take on a life of their own, and as certain characters try t manipulate events to their own advantage.  As a listener, I found quite a bit to laugh at, but I also found a fair exposition on how we often see what we want to see and miss the clues which should tell us that reality is otherwise.","reviewtitle":"An enjoyable character study","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2009-07-16 14:42:52","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Second in Trollope's Barsetshire series, Barchester Towers concerns the family of the Reverend Septimus Harding, whom we first met in The Warden. The new bishop has arrived, accompanied by his domineering wife and her hand-picked clerical cohort, the hypocritical Obadiah Slope. A sharply satirical comedy of errors ensues, played out by a cast of memorable characters who struggle for power, position, love, and money. Trollope knew human nature, and he knew how to portray it in both its positive and negative aspects. Part of the appeal of Barchester Towers is that he is able to do so with relative gentleness, without preaching or obvious moralizing. I'm looking forward to the sequel, to find out what happens to the bishop's virago of a wife.","reviewtitle":"Much ado","reviewer":"katknit","reviewdate":"2009-08-11 15:50:57","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This is a wonderful story, unfortunately though many of the chapters are read by someone who has difficulty pronouncing many English sounds. I had to strain to understand many of the words she said, and I found trying to make out what she was saying frustrating.","reviewtitle":"Difficult to Understand","reviewer":"bowhows","reviewdate":"2010-12-24 00:50:11","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"A magnificent novel almost ruined by one of the readers whose accent is so thick that many times you cannot understand the words being spoken. Understandably the readers to Librivox are volunteers but one would think there would be a minimum competency required. Why in the world would someone with a very thick German(?) accent be allowed to read a Victorian English novel? Why wouldn't that reader read books in German, of which Librivox needs more. It seems some of the readers are only reading for their own vanity, not in the interests of the books or the listeners. Miserable job Librivox!","reviewtitle":"wonderful novel ruined by bad reading","reviewer":"william hauff","reviewdate":"2013-01-09 18:58:29","stars":"1"},{"reviewbody":"The reason that non-native speakers of English are permitted to read English texts is that they volunteer to do so. LibriVox is an all-volunteer organization, and there is no centralized authority telling readers what they are 'allowed' to read. Nothing could be more inimical to the spirit of a volunteer-run organization.\n\nNow, aside from the obvious option of paying for a professionally produced recording, you also have the option of signing up at LibriVox and recording the chapters that displease you, or recording the entire book as a solo work. Multiple versions of books and chapters are encouraged there.","reviewtitle":"To william hauff","reviewer":"Nullifidian","reviewdate":"2013-01-13 16:20:21"},{"reviewbody":"A fun and light story filled with all sorts of conversations about the goings on around Barchester towers and the intrigues and politics involved. Some chapters are ready by Andy Minter, one of my favorites. The others are OK.","reviewtitle":"Enjoyable story with some good readers","reviewer":"Eddie Z","reviewdate":"2013-09-19 04:19:29","stars":"4"}]},
