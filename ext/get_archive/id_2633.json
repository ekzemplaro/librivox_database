M. Smallheer. \n\nA top ten bestseller of 1906, <i>The House of a Thousand Candles<\/i> is part adventure\/mystery and part romance. The book begins with young Jack Glenarm returning from various exploits in Europe and Africa for the reading of his grandfather\u2019s will. In it, he stands to inherit his grandfather\u2019s estate, but only if he can remain for one year in residence at the old man\u2019s unfinished \u201cHouse of a Thousand Candles\u201d in Annandale, Indiana, with only his grandfather\u2019s mysterious valet for company. If he violates the terms of the will, the house will go to a young woman, heretofore unknown to him, whom the will also forbids Jack to marry if he wants to retain his inheritance. This all sounds very mundane to Jack and he fully expects to be quite bored in very short order. Soon after Jack\u2019s arrival at Glenarm House, however, various strange occurrences ensue, and he soon finds himself absorbed in the most lively adventure of his life! (summary by J. M. Smallheer)\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2009-01-11"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks; mystery; best-sellers"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-01-11 21:48:59"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-01-11 22:08:38","2010-03-18 00:54:15","2010-09-24 03:22:22","2010-09-24 03:26:53","2010-09-30 14:49:58","2011-06-17 09:45:09"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":6,"avg_rating":"4.83"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Any amount of additional narration would give the plot twists away, so I won't do that.  I will say that this book is both suspensful and fun.  Definitely one of the best so far.  Narration was also very well done.","reviewtitle":"Excellent book","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2009-01-19 15:28:01","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I've listened to quite a few Librivox mysteries, and as a general class, they are fun, with their twists and turns and surprise endings.  But this one rises to the top as one of the best.  It is grounded, surprising but not unbelievable, and when you reach the end and look back, the pieces along the way have fit together very nicely. Jack Glenarm is so well drawn that you rejoice in his triumphs and groan at his failures as he struggles to remain true to his commitment to honor the last wishes of his grandfather. And it does a splendid job showing the beauty of Indiana -- the lakes and fields and woods which make the Midwest such a wonderful part of America.\n\nJ. M. Smallheer (notyouraveragejo) is an excellent reader and one of my favorites.  She is clear and uses voicing effectively to cast and enliven her characters.  I would recommend any book that she reads - its sure to be well done.","reviewtitle":"One of the best Librivox mysteries","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2010-01-28 15:30:28","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This story was good except that it was probably the basis for a lot of other books and movies and so it is easy to see what generally will happen. It is still very good though, especially if you have an interest in old houses with hidden secrets and lost treasures. Also the reader is very good, for a woman to read the roles of several male characters as well as she did deserves an award.","reviewtitle":"Very Good, but easy to predict now days.","reviewer":"Pyrodin123321","reviewdate":"2010-02-22 13:50:54","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"I love these old books with their unique quality that is impossible to find in modern books. I even like that it is a little overlong. The reader is very good & she made it a joy to listen.","reviewtitle":"I liked this book!","reviewer":"mcm2500","reviewdate":"2010-06-23 19:20:33","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I found this mystery compelling and well read. I'm now hooked on audio books. Much of the book is dialog and the reader presented each character appropriately.","reviewtitle":"My first audio book, an excellent introduction","reviewer":"cyndiegran","reviewdate":"2010-06-24 05:32:04","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"The story itself is really good and I enjoyed it.  The narration was good and this narrator really made the characters engaging and endearing.  Nice work!  This one is nice light entertainment, enjoy!","reviewtitle":"Entertaining and well narrated","reviewer":"benefitsingers","reviewdate":"2010-07-01 14:42:31","stars":"5"}]},
