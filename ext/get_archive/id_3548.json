Some of his longer works are clearly intended for adults, and this fantastic fiction influenced later writers such as G.K. Chesterton, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. But you can find some of his best writing in the stories aimed squarely at children, and these are three of the finest.\n\nThe Light Princess. A wicked aunt curses her baby niece so that gravity has no effect on her, and she floats through the air as if it were water.The only way to break the curse is to make the princess cry.\n\nThe Giant's Heart. Two children argue and run away to Giantland. There they find out that one of the Giants steals children from the land of men and eats them, but how can they kill the Giant when he has hidden his heart where no one can find it?\n\nThe Golden Key. A boy discovers a Golden Key, but cannot find the lock. He meets a girl, and together they search for the land from where the shadows fall, hoping that the key will allow them in.\nSummary by Clive Catterall)\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of Complete Book<\/a>"],"date":["2010-06-01"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; fairy tales; George MacDonald; Light Princess"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-06-01 20:01:39"],"addeddate":["2010-06-01 19:41:29"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-06-01 20:20:46","2010-06-01 20:36:03","2010-06-06 10:53:55"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},

When my mp3 player died and I had to wait till the next day to hear the end of The Giant's Heart I was left on tenterhooks. I enjoyed every second.\n\nAn entertaining set of Fairy Tales by George MacDonald. I've read other things by the same author and not enjoyed them, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this collection of stories both humourous and heart-warming.","reviewtitle":"Excellent Reading of Lovely Stories","reviewer":"Lucy_k_p","reviewdate":"2010-10-10 17:18:26","stars":"5"}]},
