Paul has met with and converted a man named Onesimus, probably a runaway slave, and he writes to Philemon, Onesimus's legal owner, to tell him that he is sending him back.  Appealing to Philemon's personal debt to him, Paul urges him to welcome Onesimus as though he were Paul himself, and to accept him as a fellow brother in Christ.

But the fact remains that the author claims to be Paul.  All the possibilities presented by scholars are based on circumstantial reasoning. The scholars have hardly come to a consensus.  \n\nIn the end,\n1. The author of the book of Philemon claims to be Paul.\n2.
