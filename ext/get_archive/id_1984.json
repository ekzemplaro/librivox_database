Read by Aleithia, Elizabeth Klett, mb, David Muncaster, Anna Simon, Miranda Stinson, Jordan Schneider, Andy, Alana Jordan,.\n\nA Doll's House, written two years after The Pillars of Society, was the first of Ibsen's plays to create a sensation and is now perhaps his most famous play, and required reading in many secondary schools and universities. The play was highly controversial when first published, as it is sharply critical of 19th Century marriage norms. It follows the formula of well-made play up until the final act, when it breaks convention by ending with a discussion, not an unravelling. It is often called the first true feminist play, although Ibsen denied this.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.50"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I usually can't listen to Librivox plays. There are no sound effects; the actors\/readers are unauditioned, and often over- or underact; the stage directions are usually read aloud; it's hard to keep track of the characters based on the voices alone; and typically, all the voices are recorded separately and spliced together, which can have a jarring effect. But once I got over the initial distaste, I really enjoyed this recording. The actors\/readers, though clearly amateurs, give low-key, expressive performances. The one who plays Nora is especially charming, and her occasional excesses seem appropriate to the character. The sound quality is good, and the audio editing strikes me as better than average. Overall the effect was midway between seeing the play performed and reading it.","reviewtitle":"Great play, pretty good recording","reviewer":"notmyname","reviewdate":"2010-05-21 17:00:07","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Our plays are undoubtedly developing in quality as we gain experience. I heartily recommend listening also to Chekhov's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/proposal_0901_librivox\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Proposal<\/a>.","reviewtitle":"Glad you enjoyed this","reviewer":"librivoxbooks","reviewdate":"2010-05-21 20:16:09"},{"reviewbody":"Thank you so much for this resource.  I work two jobs and I'm going to school. I needed to read this play for a European literature class and was able to listen to  it in audiobook form while in my car.  I found it to be a very enjoyable and efficient experience.  I must say Dr. Rank was my favorite actor, I was enamored with his accent!  5 stars for Dr. Rank.","reviewtitle":"Made my life easier and more enjoyable","reviewer":"karolynns","reviewdate":"2014-07-16 00:11:56","stars":"5"}]},
