"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"4.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"\nAs a memoir this book is well written and always interesting. It follows the exploits and life of a man who leads from the front and has some firm ideas about how the law should be implemented.\n\nThe general outline of the book is a series of anecdotes and interesting cases and situations that the officer in question has been involved in. Ranging from dealing with foreign dignitaries to cattle thieves and gun toting \"Indians\", the telling is always well delivered and is never boring. The author has the knack of limiting his tales to the pertinent facts and only including stories that have some element of interest to the reader\/listener.\n\nThe reader is an experienced librivox reader has a good delivery, so if you have any interest in the history covered I think your going to like this one.\n\nFor more of my reviews of free audio found on the web please visit http:\/\/freeaudioreview.blogspot.com\/","reviewtitle":"Free Audio Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2009-02-04 16:54:42","stars":"4"}]},
