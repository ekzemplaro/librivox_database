He lived with Twain, collecting ideas and material for a biography, for a few years before Twain\u2019s death in 1910. Six years later Paine published this \u201cstory of a man who made the world laugh and love him.\u201d\n\n    For those who have read or listened to Mark Twain\u2019s works, Paine\u2019s work is an invaluable resource to better understand Twain, the stories behind his stories and his life with those he loved and with whom he worked. (Summary by John Greenman)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-boys-life-of-mark-twain\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks4\/BoysLifeOfMarkTwainPart1.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B part 1 (121MB)<\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks4\/BoysLifeOfMarkTwainPart2.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B part 2 (123MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2008-10-10"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["librivox;  audiobook;  biography; Twain"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-10-11 01:38:50"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-10-11 02:48:09","2010-04-14 00:19:08","2012-02-15 09:09:26"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311092637[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020009"]},
