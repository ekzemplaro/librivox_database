Read by Clive Catterall.\n\nSet during the Hundred Years' War with France, <i>The White Company<\/i> tells the story of a young Saxon man who is learning what it is to be a knight. Raised by Cistercian Monks and rejected by a violent elder brother, Alleyn Edricson takes service with one of the foremost knights in the country. When Alleyn falls in love with the knight's daughter, he must prove himself to be a courageous and honourable knight before he can win her hand. Alleyn and his friends set forth with the other men-at-arms to join Prince Edward in Bordeaux, from where they will take part in the Prince's campaign into Spain. It is in Spain that Alleyn and others must prove themselves to be very valiant and hardy cavaliers. (Summary by Clive Catterall)\n\nFor further information, including links to M4B audio book, online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-white-company-by-sir-arthur-conan-doyle\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"date":["2009-07-24"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; fiction; historical fiction; knights; Hundred Years' War; Middle Ages; Doyle"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-07-24 08:15:17"],"addeddate":["2009-07-24 06:23:39"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2009-07-24 11:31:07"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140323064637[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020416"]},

This is a wonderful story - with adventures galore, sword fights, honor, cultural commentary, and plenty of humor sprinkled in.  By my ten finger bones, but Clive Catterall does an excellent job reading the characters!","reviewtitle":"Knights, squires, archers and adventure","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2009-09-08 14:11:13","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Having recently completed his education in a monastery, Allen is required by the terms of his father's will to leave the monastery and spend a year in the world.  He ventures forth and finds romance and adventure, but not without showing courage first as part of the White Company.  \n\nThe story is very interesting, kept me listening, and the reader did an excellent job.  A little tinny sounding, but the equalizer filtered it out without issues.","reviewtitle":"Interesting Story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2009-09-28 20:02:27","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"Mr. Cattereal,  This is to thank you for your nonpareil rendition of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \nfantastic tale of Chivalry in his historical fiction \"The White Company\".  You have given me hours of enjoyable listening to your wonderful pallet of voices and continuous melodious vocalization throughout the duration of the book.
