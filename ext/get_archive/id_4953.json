She proposes that, within the human race, five sub-types have developed through evolutionary processes, each with its own distinct character traits and corresponding outward appearance. She offers to teach the reader how to recognise these five types of people and understand their innate differences. Her ideas have never been taken seriously by the scientific community, but this book is considered a classic within its genre and remains in print today. \n\nSummary by Carl Manchester.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/how-to-analyse-people-on-sight-by-benedict-and-benedict\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"subject":["psychology; pseudoscience; audiobook; librivox"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2011-05-22 19:00:55"],"addeddate":["2011-05-22 18:46:03"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2011-05-22 19:03:52","2011-05-23 11:26:26"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
