Gallun.  Read by Gregg Margarite.\n\nWhen an alien spacecraft crashes in Missouri a team of army investigators is dispatched. Among the debris they find a Martian infant and decide to raise him in their lab. Is he too strange to form a relationship with humans? Maybe, but he does have cute eye-stalks. \u2013 Stamped Caution was first published in the August 1953 issue of Galaxy magazine.

Now it is time to take him home.  But wait?  Why are those aliens capturing the people who saved one of their own? \n\nNeat story, I got a big kick out of it.  Gregg is a great reader.
