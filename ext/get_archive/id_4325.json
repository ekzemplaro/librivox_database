Some of the stories appeared in this collection for the first time translated into English, and many of them come from unexpected sources, such as the letters of Pliny the Younger, or a Tibetan manuscript. In the third volume, we find stories written by English and Irish authors.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"3.67"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"There was one reader who read several stories and they were unlistenable, too many mic taps. \n\nOf the stories I could listen to, the readers were very good, but the stories were blah IMHO. It seemed like the authors were trying too hard to tell a mysterious and emotional story at the same time.  I found them annoying rather than entertaining.  \n\nI don't think it's a bad book, just not a good one, it is just so-so.","reviewtitle":"I didn't get into this book","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2011-02-09 16:24:03","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"If you like mystery stories, these are for you. Enjoy!","reviewtitle":"Good stories if you're into it.","reviewer":"serrafina","reviewdate":"2011-08-18 17:47:31","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"As in volume 1, the adjectives \"mystery\" and \"detective\" are kind of a stretch for some of these stories. The stories in the beginning and the end are pretty good, but the collection does meander off course in the middle. Probably the most disruptive thing is one reader who is very difficult to listen to because of poor audio quality, assorted mouth sounds, heavy breathing, and random long pauses midsentence. (And vocally it's considered good practice for men to not do women's voices in falsetto because it is difficult to understand and possibly painful to the ears through headphones!) Although I do appreciate the attempt to add dramatic interest by using character voices, a regular-voiced reading focusing on the content as well as clear enunciation and pronunciation, with pauses and emphasis where appropriate, is almost always better (unless, of course, you're \u00fcber-talented like Mil Nicholson). However, aside from this one misguided exception, the readers are quite good overall.","reviewtitle":"A mixed bag, but some stories are worth listening to","reviewer":"glttrgrl8","reviewdate":"2014-08-19 05:34:23","stars":"3"}]},
