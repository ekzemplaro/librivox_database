Although some of his methods, equipment and mores may be out of date or objectionable to modern readers, his stories of true wilderness travel tinged with his subtle humor still have messages for those venturing out of doors. His small stature and compromised health made him a proponent of lightweight backpacking and canoe travel with only essential gear, a lesson still relevant today. There is a reason why \"Woodcraft\" and the slightly abridged, \"Woodcraft and Camping\", have been continuously in print since its original publication. - Summary by Fritz<br \/> For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/woodcraft-by-nessmuk\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.<br \/><br \/> For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks_16\/woodcraft_1404.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B Format Available<\/a>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"mediatype":["audio"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks;camping; nessmuk; canoeing; wilderness travel"],"title":["Woodcraft"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"],"publicdate":["2014-04-26 12:38:01"],"addeddate":["2014-04-26 12:38:01"],"year":["2014"],"boxid":["OL100020402"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},
