It was a most unnatural disaster.<p>On November 19, the chief executive made the trip to the still-dazed, shot-torn community to deliver, almost as an afterthought (for he was not the keynote speaker), an address that clarified his belief that the Negro race should be liberated from its slavery, and that despite the loss of so much blood and life, the Union should hold to the goal of completing this emancipation.<\/p><p>That he knew the eyes of the nation would rest of him was evident; this address was the first speech since his inauguration that he prepared in advance. But these carefully crafted words - only 269 of them - became a vital part of our nation's identity, and are a signature to the bedrock of our beliefs.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-gettysburg-address-by-abraham-lincoln-2\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to find out how you can volunteer, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2007-05-30"],"year":["2007"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; non-fiction; gettysburg; lincoln"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-05-30 13:25:51"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2007-05-30 15:35:38"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140318154329[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020005"]},
