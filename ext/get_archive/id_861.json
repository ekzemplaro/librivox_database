Published in 1849 under the title Resistance to Civil Government, it expressed Thoreau\u2019s belief that people should not allow governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty both to avoid doing injustice directly and to avoid allowing their acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War. \n\n(Summary from Wikipedia).\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/on-the-duty-of-civil-disobedience-by-henry-david-thoreau\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; thoreau; government; essay; resistance"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-02-11 09:19:59"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2007-02-11 09:24:13"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"]},
