Read by Maria Kasper.\n\n\"The long war has brought hunger to Europe; some of her peoples stand constantly face to face with starvation. To meet all this great food need in Europe\u2014and meeting it is an imperative military necessity\u2014we must be very careful and economical in our food use here at home. We must eat less; we must waste nothing; we must equalize the distribution of what food we may retain for ourselves; we must prevent extortion and profiteering which make prices so high that the poor cannot buy the food they actually need; and we must try to produce more food. For all this there is needed a \"food education\" of all our people. For the purpose of diffusing this information this little book has been prepared under the direction of the Food Administration. By following the suggestions for food conservation herein contained every one can render his country an important war service.\" (Summary excerpted from the Preface by Herbert Hoover) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/food-guide-for-war-service-at-home-by-katherine-blunt-frances-swain-and-florence-powdermaker\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2013-05-24"],"year":["2013"],"subject":["WWI; home front; food production; rationing; audiobook; Librivox; World War I"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"]},
