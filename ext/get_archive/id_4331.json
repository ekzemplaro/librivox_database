Though he loves her truly, she has severe misgivings. She goes through with the wedding in spite of this, but refuses to live with her new husband, and cannot be enticed or cajoled to do so. Then on the day the Captain is scheduled to ship out, she receives word that he has been gravely injured and his dying request is to see his wife. She flies to his side... and thus begins an adventure spanning eight years - love, loathing, shipwreck, love lost, and redemption. (Summary by P. Cunningham and Nadine Eckert-Boulet)\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of complete book<\/a>\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/abandoned-by-w-clark-russell\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"date":["2010-12-18"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["Audiobook; LibriVox; Clark Russell; Captain Francis Reynolds; British Merchant Service; Sea Stories; Lucretia Lane; literature; fiction; adventure"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2010-12-18 13:36:07"],"addeddate":["2010-12-18 12:36:48"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2010-12-18 14:53:26","2010-12-18 19:40:49"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"3.67"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Captain Reynolds' wife abandons him on their wedding day.  He contrives to try to win her back, but alas, the fates have other plans in mind.  I won't say more than that so as to not give the plot away, but this is a very sweet story with a happy ending.\n\nOkay, now don't flame me for saying this...  \n\nAs a general rule I give 4 or 5 stars to most books because they are well read and nicely done, but this book had a lot of errors in the PL which was extremely distracting.  So 4 stars for the story, but maybe a little more attention to the PL next time.","reviewtitle":"Great story, less than perfect rendering...","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2011-01-07 19:07:10","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"This was one of the worst narrated books at Librivox I have ever listened to.  Who proof listened to this.  The first two narrators were good so that is how I at least got started into the book.  Those two narrators along with Joshua and Ruth Golding were the only saving grace to this poorly narrated book.  The rest of the readers were actually painful to listen to.  The final chapter read by Gary O was terrible and he never even said the end.  Fortunately the story itself was good enough and the narrators spoke clearly enough that I could tolerate the poorly narrated chapters. The best part of the story is the castaway portion and I thought was really the better part of the book.  There were issues with the story itself and honestly sometimes the characters did not always have my sympathy.  Personally I think Frank could have done a lot better than Lucretia.  This is a good enough story I hope that maybe a re-recording of it might be done.","reviewtitle":"Story 4, reading 1","reviewer":"benefitsingers","reviewdate":"2011-03-08 16:28:29","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"I cannot agree with the other two reviewers. The story is interesting and combines adventure with romance. There are some mistakes in the reading, but they are not so distracting as to take away the fun from the book.
