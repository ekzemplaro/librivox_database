It was he who initiated the hostilities by opening fire on Ft. Sumter in Charleston harbor, in April, 1861. \n\nIn July of that year, having taken command of the Confederate Army of the Potomac, he triumphed in the first serious clash of the war, at Manassas, Virginia. His army, aided by reinforcements from Johnston's army in the Shenandoah Valley, routed a Federal army under General McDowell. Had it been his army instead that routed, it is possible the Civil War might have ended that same year, as the path to Richmond would have been wide open. \n\nThis is his account of the battle, including the strategic situation leading up to it. As an afterward, he added a very revealing appraisal of the relations between him and Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and the reasons why, in his opinion, the South failed to win its war of secession.\n\nSummary and recording by Mark F. Smith\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-first-battle-of-bull-run-by-pierre-gustave-toutant-beauregard\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxCollectionM4BAudiobook10\/FirstBattleOfBullRun_32kb.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (47MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2007-01-20"],"year":["2007"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; history; Civil War"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"public":["1"],"publicdate":["2007-01-25 16:34:57"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2007-01-25 16:36:31","2011-04-19 01:33:59"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140319033036[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020408"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},

To my delight I found that it was read by one of my favourite Librivox readers, Mark Smith.\n\nThe book was well paced, with the General leading us though the run up to the battle and into the events of the battle itself. I found it very interesting and satisfying to hear the details and concerns of a General who was actually there in the middle of the action.\n\nIf you have any interest in the American Civil War, then this book is a must read(listen) and due to it being a short one, you no excuse not to!\n\nReading 3\/3\nProduction 2\/3\nStory 3\/3\n\nTotal Score 8\/9\n\nFind more of my free audio reviews at http:\/\/freeaudioreview.blogspot.com","reviewtitle":"Free Audio Review","reviewer":"FNH","reviewdate":"2008-06-21 11:03:11","stars":"5"}]},
