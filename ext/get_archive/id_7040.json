The Repairman (1958) is a straight fun SF story of a man getting a job done. It is most typical of his later style in series like the Stainless Steel Rat; Toy Shop (1962), a short piece exploring bureaucratic blindness and one ingenious way around it and The Velvet Glove (1956), my favorite for its writing style, fun perspective, sly social commentary on the scene in 1956 and just plain delightful imagination. And he manages to pack excitement and mystery in at the same time.   \n\n    For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-repairman-by-harry-harrison\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n    For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1a\/Repairman.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2012-09-08"],"year":["2012"],"subject":["harry harrison; librivox; science fiction; SF; short stories;audiobook"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321044336[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020215"]},
