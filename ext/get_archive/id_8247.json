Her best-known work was Poems of Passion. Her most enduring work was \" Solitude\", which contains the lines: \"Laugh, and the world laughs with you; Weep, and you weep alone\". Her autobiography, The Worlds and I, was published in 1918, a year before her death.\nA popular poet rather than a literary poet, in her poems she expresses sentiments of cheer and optimism in plainly written, rhyming verse. Her world view is expressed in the title of her poem \"Whatever Is\u2014Is Best\".\nNone of Wilcox's works were included by F. O. Matthiessen in The Oxford Book of American Verse, but Hazel Felleman chose no fewer than fourteen of her poems for Best Loved Poems of the American People, while Martin Gardner selected \"Solitude\" and \"The Winds of Fate\" for Best Remembered Poems.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-age-of-the-motored-things-by-ella-wheeler-wilcox\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B Format Available<\/a>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"mediatype":["audio"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks; poetry; culture"],"title":["The Age of the Motored Things"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"],"publicdate":["2013-10-20 11:41:14"],"addeddate":["2013-10-20 11:41:14"],"year":["2013"]},
