Reminiscences of a Southern Hospital is her vivid recounting of hospital life and of her tribulations (and personal growth) as a female administrator. To follow her from day one, when she is greeted with \u201cill-repressed disgust\u201d that \u201cone of them had come,\u201d and she, herself, \u201ccould only understand that the position was one which dove-tailed the offices of housekeeper and cook\u201d to the day when she as exerts control over the hospital\u2019s \u201cmedicinal whiskey barrel\u201d is to watch a woman find herself. Besides describing \u201cdaily scenes of pathos,\u201d Pember gives a horrifying account of the prisoner exchange of November 1864 (\u201cliving and dead . . . not distinguishable\u201d), and also of the evacuation and burning of Richmond in 1865. Her memoirs were serialized in Cosmopolite magazine in 1866, then reprinted in book form in 1879 under the title A Southern Woman\u2019s Story. Pember was honored by the US Postal Service with a stamp in 1995.
