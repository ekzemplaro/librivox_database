He wrote The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, arguably the most famous published Christian allegory. In the Church of England he is remembered with a Lesser Festival on 30 August.\n\nBunyan became a popular preacher as well as a prolific author, though most of his works consist of expanded sermons. In theology he was a Puritan, but there was nothing gloomy about him. The portrait his friend Robert White drew, which has often been reproduced, shows the attractiveness of his true character.\n\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/miscellaneous-pieces-by-john-bunyan\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks5\/MiscellaneousPieces.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (25MB)<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; religion"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-02-28 06:05:28"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-02-28 06:11:37","2012-01-07 07:47:44"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140313043636[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020301"]},
