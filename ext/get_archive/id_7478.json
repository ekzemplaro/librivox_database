The Committee was charged with conducting \"a full and complete investigation and study and to report its findings to the House not later than February 15, 2006, regarding-- (1) the development, coordination, and execution by local, State, and Federal authorities of emergency response plans and other activities in preparation for Hurricane Katrina; and (2) the local, State, and Federal government response to Hurricane Katrina.\"<br \/><br \/>The Committee presents the report narrative and the findings that stem from it to the U.S. House of Representatives and the American people for their consideration. Members of the Select Committee agree unanimously with the report and its findings. Other Members of Congress who participated in the Select Committee\u2019s hearings and investigation but were not official members of the Select Committee, while concurring with a majority of the report\u2019s findings, have presented additional views as well, which we offer herein on their behalf.<br \/><br \/>First and foremost, this report is issued with our continued thoughts and prayers for Katrina\u2019s victims. Their families. Their friends. The loss of life, of property, of livelihoods and dreams has been enormous. And we salute all Americans who have stepped up to the plate to help in any way they can.
