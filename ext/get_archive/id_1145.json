"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":4,"avg_rating":"3.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"If you don't mind a droning emotionless voice reading great fantasy stories, then this is for you!  As an added bonus, it sounds like the reader was chewing gum, or had some annoying popping mouth malady that made me want to pierce my eardrums.","reviewtitle":"Bad reading, great stories","reviewer":"thecrwth","reviewdate":"2007-12-14 06:36:08","stars":"1"},{"reviewbody":"While I didn't notice the 'popping mouth malady' that \"thecrwth\" mentioned, it was read with a dry delivery that did not linger enough on Dunsany's great words. Dunsany, and especially this book, deserve a reader, an actor, of high merit; not a well intentioned amateur. Still, I will not let my disappointment that the 'Book of Wonder' was not done all justice, lead me to insult a reader who obviously loves Dunsany as much as I do. In a world in which Dunsany is an obscure little known author, it seems overly cruel to castigate someone for trying to spread 'wonder' to others.","reviewtitle":"Somewhat agree with \"thecrwth\"","reviewer":"booksarecool","reviewdate":"2007-12-18 09:21:54","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"You need to be patient with this one: it's like Lovecraft in that the author has never met an adjective he can't fit in somewhere.  The stories are good, but deliberately don't have satisfactory narrative forms, which makes them more like the abrupt folktales sometimes found in oral collections.\n\nThe read is lingering and monotonous. During the first story I wanted the reader to do more with his voice, but from the second onward, it had an odd effect on me, like a person chanting a story they had spoken thousands of times before, which added fidelity to these stories of unknown gods, so I grew to really like it, as one of those choices I did not know I'd enjoy until I tried.","reviewtitle":"A good book","reviewer":"Timothy Ferguson","reviewdate":"2011-10-10 15:11:18","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"I think the reader is under rated, after reading others reviews. His reading style matches the stories very well, and people should be thankful that someone spent their time to make this audiobook. The stories themselves are compact and perfectly crafted, I enjoyed hearing them again and again. Wish I could hear him read- A Dreamers Tales, by Lord Dunsany.","reviewtitle":"Greats stories, Great reader","reviewer":"Daturus","reviewdate":"2013-06-14 21:12:24","stars":"5"}]},
