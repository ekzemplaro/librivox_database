He was known for the J. G. Reeder detective stories, The Four Just Men, the Ringer, and for creating the Green Archer character during his lifetime.

"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":5,"avg_rating":"4.20"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Edgar Wallace has a singular talent with writing a good mystery novel that keeps you wondering who the bad guy is while interjecting a nice romance in the middle of it.  This is done without getting too sloppy or unbelievable.  The addition of the Oriental assistant in this story adds to the mystique of the detective, who is called in to help solve the murder of a person who had only a day before tried to hire him.  The twist?  The victim had tried to hire the detective to FRAME someone!  The story starts quickly, moves at a quick pace, and keeps you listening up until the end.  The readers of the book also did a fabulous job.","reviewtitle":"Exceptional story!","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2008-09-23 19:52:29","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Detective Jack Tarling has returned to London from Shanghai, where he earned his reputation as Lieh Jen, the Hunter of Men. He's called in by Thornton Lyne to investigate a substantial theft only to see the job turn into one of petty vengeance against Odette Rider, a pretty young clerk in Lyne's store who has rejected his advances.  Tarling rejects the job but later pays a call on Odette to warn her of Lyne's attempts to frame her for theft. Imagine his surprise when he is called in by Scotland Yard to consult on the murder of Thornton Lyne in Odette Rider's flat, only to find that Miss Rider has disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe story has plenty of twists and turns, keeps you guessing, but doesn't stretch belief.  And under it all you see Jack Tarling's growing attachment to Odette, and his struggle to piece together the mystery that surrounds her and Lyne's death.  It's a great mixture of mystery and romance - one of those books that keeps you up far into the night to find out what happens next.","reviewtitle":"Loved this mystery\/romance","reviewer":"ListeninginChicago","reviewdate":"2009-11-10 03:00:36","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"dated story but ecellent story and readers","reviewtitle":"The Daffodil Mystery","reviewer":"ronzed","reviewdate":"2010-06-24 18:30:47","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I thought this would be a lot better since it was written by Edgar Wallace. However, it was not bad, a little too long and predictable.

Having a mix of readers was somewhat distracting.  One reader was very poor.  In spite of this, we still enjoyed it.","reviewtitle":"Excellent book, mediocre readers","reviewer":"kenlorne","reviewdate":"2011-02-03 20:04:05","stars":"4"}]},
