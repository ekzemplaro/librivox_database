Her experiences in the Great War, brief and traumatizing as they were, permeated the prose and poetry she wrote after this time. Witness of great human pain and tragedy, Sinclair was in serious danger of her life on multiple occasions. This journal makes no attempt to be anything more than a journal: a lucid, simple, heart-breaking account of war at first hand. - Summary by Expatriate<br \/><br \/> For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-journal-of-impressions-in-belgium-by-may-sinclair\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording.<br \/><br \/> For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks_11\/journalimpressionsbelgium_1312.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (171MB)<\/a>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/mark\/1.0\/"],"mediatype":["audio"],"subject":["librivox; audiobooks;World War I"],"title":["A Journal of Impressions in Belgium"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"],"publicdate":["2013-12-23 10:53:27"],"addeddate":["2013-12-23 10:53:27"],"year":["2013"],"boxid":["OL100020313"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},
