Somerset Maugham. \nRead by Termin Dyan. \n\nThis Maugham novel is based on the life of the painter Paul Gauguin. The story is told by the narrator as he gradually comes to know the main character Charles Strickland, a middle aged stock broker. We follow Strickland from the point where he abruptly abandons his wife and children to become an artist, through his life in Paris and Marseille to Tahiti, where he eventually dies of leprosy. (Summary by Andy Minter) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/moon-and-sixpence-the-by-w-somerset-maugham\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks5\/MoonAndTheSixpencePart1.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B Part 1 (109mb)<\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks5\/MoonAndTheSixpencePart2.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B Part 2 (110mb)<\/a>\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"date":["2009-11-23"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; Gauguin, artist"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-11-23 21:52:32"],"addeddate":["2009-11-23 21:11:34"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-11-24 02:05:37","2009-11-24 02:19:07","2009-11-24 03:49:36","2011-02-17 11:57:27"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"runtime":["7:51:01"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311202217[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020513"]},
