Two associates, wishing to right the wrong, are commissioned to find a missing heir. Their quest takes them from fungous wine cellars in the City of London to the sunshine of the Mediterranean \u2014 across the Alps in winter. Danger and treachery would prevail were it not for the courage of the heroine and the faithful company servant.\n\nThe story contains crafted descriptions, well-drawn and diverse characters, eerie and exotic backgrounds, mystery, semi-concealed identities, brinkmanship with death, romance, the eventual triumph of Good over Evil, and many other elements expected in classic Dickens. \n\nFirst published in 1867 there are thematic parallels with other books from Dickens' mature writings, including Little Dorrit (1857) and especially Our Mutual Friend (1865). The Listener will decide if this story yields insights into The Mystery of Edwin Drood (unfinished 1870).\n\nWilkie Collings collaborated with Charles Dickens to produce this \u2018Christmas\u2019 book and the stage play of the same name. In the book Collins assisted in Act 1 and Act 4; Collins scripted most of the stage play with Dickens\u2019 assistance. If this book were released today it would be splashed \"THE BOOK OF THE FILM\".\n\n(Summary by Alan Chant).\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/no-thoroughfare-by-charles-dickens\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/Books_Available_in_m4b_format\" rel=\"nofollow\"> M4B format available<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; literature; christmas"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-04-08 17:34:12"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2007-04-08 17:42:20"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140318182900[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020109"]},

It's just 6 hours - rather short for a Dickens audiobook, but includes a cast of interesting characters, which Alan brings to life with his excellent reading voices.
