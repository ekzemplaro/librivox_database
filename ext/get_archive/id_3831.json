Read by Gregg Margarite (1957-2012).\n\n\u201cThe Creature from Cleveland Depths\u201d also known as \u201cThe Lone Wolf\u201d tells the story of a writer and his wife who refuse to move below-ground after the cold-war gets hot. The underground society discovers a decline in their ability to creatively innovate, and must consult with surface dwellers to develop products that satiate the needs of a people living like moles. But the latest product to result from this alliance, \u201cThe Tickler\u201d has frightening implications that only our heroes seem to notice. \u2013 This story appeared in the December, 1962 issue of \u201cGalaxy\u201d magazine. (Summary by Gregg Margarite)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-creature-from-cleveland-depths-by-fritz-leiber\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2009-12-15"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; science fiction; scifi; cold war; underground"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-12-16 01:34:05"],"addeddate":["2009-12-16 01:23:27"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-12-16 02:07:29","2011-01-17 09:16:59"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311113331[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020210"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"4.33"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"I marvel at the predictive insights of some scifi stories, this book is conceptually really scary and predictive of what might happen with time. I like the technological and social concepts in this book as well as the dystopic(or realistic!) vision of the future. I wonder if something like \"the tickler\" will be the cellphone's progeny......good litle book, I can't believe it's from 1962....","reviewtitle":"CREEPY!","reviewer":"Pyrodin123321","reviewdate":"2010-02-12 14:55:33","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This science fiction story is quite funny. It struck me as slow and predictable compared to most of the contemporary sci-fi I've read, and a little dated (the use of the word \"midget\" for example), but still very enjoyable. (And if your Tivo and iPhone apps run your life, it might give you pause.)\n\nI think I've listened to some of Gregg Margarite's other recordings. He always gives a solid reading with good sound quality, and this is no exception. I think his voice is quite appropriate to the main character too.","reviewtitle":"Decent story, good reading","reviewer":"notmyname","reviewdate":"2010-02-12 21:48:34","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"This is almost a precursor to iRobot, IMHO.  \n\nPeople are always forgetting things; chores, medicine, when to go to bed.  So the Tickler is invented to help people remember.  It is so easy to use, just hook it up to your brain and do what it tells you to do.  Let's just hope it doesn't become sentient, eh? \n\nWell read story, really creepy, neat ending.  Enjoy!\n","reviewtitle":"Neat story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-10-11 13:41:45","stars":"5"}]},
