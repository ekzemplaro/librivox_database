The narrative chronicles the trials of Job as he is brought low from a comfortable and exalted position in his community to face loss of his fortune, children and health. Joined by three friends who initially commiserate and sympathize with him, there ensues a lengthy argument about the fate of the wicked and the just and much questioning about the character of God and the justice He metes out to his creations.<br \/><br \/>A quite lively and poetic discussion ensues among these wise elders and their suppositions and conclusions are eventually contested by a youth who enters the discussion toward the end. God has the final word in this narrative and Job is left to abjectly acknowledge that his complaints and knowledge mean little in the face of that which is so far beyond his ability to comprehend.<br \/><br \/>Debate regarding the meaning, purpose and author of this book is still hotly contested among biblical scholars. It is far beyond the scope of this summary to offer any conclusions regarding this work. The reader offers the words to the listener with no judgment or further explanation.<br \/><br \/>Even without deep examination, the poetic nature of the story offers many insights into facing and overcoming adversity.<br \/>(Summary by Robert Garrison)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-book-of-job\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/book_of_job_librivox\/BookOfJobAsv_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (69MB)<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox;  audiobook;  literature"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-04-12 20:20:35"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-04-12 20:23:16","2011-10-14 09:35:56"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140319071801[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020511"],"runtime":["2:27:29"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"]},
