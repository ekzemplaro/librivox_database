Translated by Gunther Olesch, Anke Dreher, Amy Coulter, Stefan Langer and Semyon Chaichenets\n\nRead by Adrian Praetzellis \n\nSiddhartha is one of the great philosophical novels. Profoundly insightful, it is also a beautifully written story that begins as Siddhartha, son of an Indian Brahman, leaves his family and begins a lifelong journey towards Enlightenment. On the way he faces the entire range of human experience and emotion: he lives with ascetics, meets Gotama the Buddha, learns the art of love from Kamala the courtesan, and is transformed by the simple philosophy of the ferryman Vasudeva whose wisdom comes not from learned teachings but from observing the River. Herman Hesse (1877-1962) was a German-Swiss novelist, poet, and painter. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946.  (Summary by Adrian Praetzellis)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/siddhartha-by-hermann-hesse\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of complete book<\/a>\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"date":["2008-06-11"],"year":["2008"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; fiction; allegory; India; Gautama Buddha; spiritual journey; enlightenment; Brahmin; ascetics"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2008-06-11 18:38:44"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2008-06-11 20:04:33","2008-06-12 01:59:09","2008-06-12 02:13:13","2008-06-12 02:44:44","2008-06-13 01:50:27","2008-06-13 03:11:50","2009-06-17 03:09:13","2011-06-11 20:32:56","2011-12-01 06:46:02","2012-01-01 07:31:40"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"runtime":["5:06:16"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311215243[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020215"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":8,"avg_rating":"4.75"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Siddhartha was once a wandering shramana and, briefly, like thousands of others, he followed Gotama the Buddha, enraptured by his sermons. But hw was not a follower of any but his own soul. Born the son of a Brahmin, Siddhartha was blessed in appearance, intelligence, and charisma. In order to find meaning in life, he discarded his promising future for the life of a wandering ascetic. Still, true happiness evaded him. Then a life of pleasure and titillation merely eroded away his spiritual gains until he was just like all the other \"child people,\" dragged around by his desires. Neither a practitioner nor a devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to blend in with the world, resonating with the rhythms of nature, bending the reader's ear down to hear answers from the river.\nMany thanks to Mr Adrian Praetzellis for his delicate and sensitive reading of Herman Hesse's book. A lovely recording.","reviewtitle":"A lovely recording","reviewer":"Philippe Horak","reviewdate":"2008-06-22 10:25:25","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This is a first-class, sublime, reading of this lovely novel.

We find Siddhartha in each one of us. It has been a tribute to listen to this wonderful insight book. Truly, a life inspiring, guiding, changing book.\n\n\"To thoroughly understand the world, to explain it, to despise it, may be the thing great thinkers do.

So, I decided to listen instead.  (And, listening is NOT a strength of mine.)\nWhat great fortune that I happened upon Librivox!  And, then, your reading!  So many times I listened again to chapters since the beauty of the prose recited by your sonorous voice and rich accent, relaxed me to sleep almost every night.  (Believe it on not, that was a COMPLIMENT. Sort of left-handed, even though.)\nI am still amazed at the coincidence of it all, too.  Just so happens I have been mesmerized by the incredible images of the cosmos coming back from the Chandra, Spitzer, Hubble space-based and the many ground-based telescopes that are revolutionizing our understanding of the the Universe.  Cosmology, in particular, is fast becoming a passion of mine.  \nSo, you may want to know how Siddhartha and cosmology relate.  I am still ignorant of both except for the most superficial understanding.  But, even that makes it clear to me that, just as our lives, indeed the world, repeat the lives of those, and the world, before us, the birth of the Universe, the life cycle of stars, matter and life and, ultimately, the death of all of that, are merely the ultimate example of circular existence, personified, if you will, by the life cycle of the River in Siddhartha.\nIt is a good start for me at fifty-one years old, and curiously-timed; I have nine more years in this decade to \"figure it all out\" like Vesudeva, Siddhartha and Govinda.\n\nIt's gonna be a blast...\n\n\nCheers\n\nTodd House, MD\nLouisville, KY \n\n","reviewtitle":"Cosmology, quantum consciousness, Siddhartha","reviewer":"Emanuel Goldstein","reviewdate":"2012-09-26 03:30:40","stars":"5"}]},
