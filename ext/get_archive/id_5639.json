Read by Lee Ann Howlett.\n\nHandsome young Tryon Dunham has just returned home on the train from a business trip one evening when he's accosted by a beautiful young woman at the station. She's terrified that she's being followed and asks Dunham if she may walk with him away from the station. Her manner and appearance are those of a well-dressed and well-bred lady. However, she refuses to tell Tryon her real name or why she is running away. He feels a responsibility for her and arranges for her to accompany him to a dinner party where she delights everyone there with her exceptional musical talent at the piano. Tryon then assists her in leaving the city on a later train that same night. Captivated by her beauty and talent, he is determined to solve the mystery of her identity. What frightened her so badly that she would leave wearing only the clothes on her back and no money? Is she an adventuress or thief masquerading as a lady in distress? A beautiful lunatic who has escaped an asylum? An heiress who has been declared missing? Tryon will not stop searching until he knows the answer. (Introduction by Lee Ann Howlett.)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-mystery-of-mary-by-grace-livingston-hill\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a><br \/>"],"date":["2011-08-27"],"year":["2011"],"subject":["Librivox; audiobook; romance; mystery; fiction"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2011-08-27 15:19:33"],"addeddate":["2011-08-27 15:00:30"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2011-08-27 15:31:22","2011-08-28 13:37:12"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"]},
