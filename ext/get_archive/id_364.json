"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":7,"avg_rating":"4.43"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This collection is pretty twisted -- four brief stories of casual murder. Not something to listen to in public, due to violence and a couple of out-of-date racial slurs.\n\nPeter Yearsley reads everything well. The sound quality is occasionally a bit off. I would have liked to have the four stories separated onto different tracks, but they're short enough that it doesn't matter too much.","reviewtitle":"Sick but funny","reviewer":"notmyname","reviewdate":"2010-04-15 19:50:12","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"No stars for the stories they were earned by the reader who did an excellent and chilling job.\n\nThe stories are ghoulish in nature so if you like that sort of thing I suppose I'd recommend these to you.","reviewtitle":"Not my taste","reviewer":"Dwnflfan","reviewdate":"2010-05-06 17:58:56","stars":"3"},{"reviewbody":"Chilling tales from a master of chilling tales. All well-read. \"Oil of Dog,\" particularly, has to be one of the most disturbing stories ever penned.\n\nGo LibriVox!","reviewtitle":"Bierce at his creepiest","reviewer":"jxchristopher","reviewdate":"2010-05-08 06:28:31","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"I liked these short stories they remind me of the masters of horror series movies. \n\nThere aren't any racial slurs, just words most people don't know or use because of the social stigma associated with the \"N\" word\n\nN*****head\n1.(nautical) A bollard made from an old cannon. \n2.An isolated part of a coral reef. \n3.The coneflower. \n4.hard tussock on tundra; often moss \n\nIt is just words people used back then, they weren't being intentionaly racist.","reviewtitle":"Good little horror tales!","reviewer":"Pyrodin123321","reviewdate":"2010-08-03 14:36:41","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Mr Bierce has a great style in weaving a horror story.  His direct, concise manner, tells his tale with a literary economy devoid of over embellishment or aggrandizement (as demonstrated by the writer of this review) or the usage of run-on sentences, (me, again)  seldom seen in the literary world, especially at the time of his career in the late 19th and early 20th century. (if I tried I bet I could do a thousand word review and do it with one sentence... maybe next time...) His dark manner conveys horror without the need to use graphic images or other gratuitous measures. I guess in my own overly verbose manner I'm trying to say, \"Hey, these stories are great!  Anyone who likes tales of the macabre should thoroughly enjoy these!\" (but heck, then the spotlight wouldn't be shining on me! what a great vehicle of egotism and an ability to turn a review into a self promotion!  I bet The Donald would approve!)\n\nWhat do you expect from a reviewer who writes and receives no renumeration? Oops, that's like when the libraries went from the Dewey Decimal System, to the Library of Congress System... I mean without REMUNERATION. \n\nMr Yearsley is a reader with few equals!  I would think Mr Bierce would be proud to have such a fine reader to tell his tales! \n\n{anybody up for reviewing the reviews??}\nPlease accept my apologies, I'm in some kind of wacky mood tonight or maybe it's an early sign of senile dementia!","reviewtitle":"Mr Bierce master of horror!","reviewer":"gl1200phil","reviewdate":"2010-11-02 09:53:12","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Okay, the stories are eerie, and if you want nightmares, well, you picked the right story.  Its creepy alright. You got your perfect mix of cannabalism, revenge, and other general weirdness.  This is a series of short stories linked by the common theme of killing one's parents.  Somebody REALLY didn't like eating their broccoli or something... \n\nThe reader is great; his cadence reminds me of Hannibal Lector discussing eating livers with Chianti and fava beans.","reviewtitle":"Holy smokes why did I download this one???","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-10-11 14:05:12","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"An excellent book, well read.","reviewtitle":"Eerie and grumsome, with a black streak of humor","reviewer":"Timothy Ferguson","reviewdate":"2011-09-14 16:01:45","stars":"5"}]},
