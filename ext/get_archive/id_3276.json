Its title refers to the London street, Grub Street, which in the 18th century became synomynous with hack literature; as an institution, Grub Street itself no longer existed in Gissing's time. Its two central characters are a sharply contrasted pair of writers:\nEdwin Reardon, a novelist of some talent but limited commercial prospects, and a shy, cerebral man; and Jasper Milvain, a young journalist, hard-working and capable of generosity, but cynical and unscrupulous about writing and its purpose in the modern (i.e. late Victorian) world.(Summary from Wikipedia) \n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/new-grub-street-by-george-gissing\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2010-01-10"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["grub street; gissing; romance; audiobooks; librivox;"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-01-10 02:35:47"],"addeddate":["2010-01-10 00:53:01"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2010-01-10 22:27:39"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321054200[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020211"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Probably Gissing\u2019s most well-known and most highly-regarded novel is the story of several professional writers in 1880s London. Theirs is a world of genteel poverty, health-ruining work, bitter literary feuds, and dreams of becoming either a famous writer or an influential tastemaker or critic as the editor of an influential journal.\n\nIn highly naturalistic fashion, Gissing explores within the unfolding of overlapping lives, how writers and their families endeavor to transcend poverty and uncertainty, and as they do so, they are faced with decision points. Some suffer because they refuse to compromise, and other suffer because they do compromise and attempt to marry for money and engage in duplicitous self-promotion and careerism. Gissing does not condemn even the most rascally or degenerate of his characters because he maintains that poverty is the force that degrades people and compels demoralizing choices. \n\nThere is no meritorious final reward for those who write works of real literary value. Instead, literature is commercialized, and success rests more on the behaviors of the buyers, whether they be individuals or public lending libraries. \n\nWhile this state of affairs seems less than remarkable to the reader of the 21st century, the mass production of print and the selling of ads, coupled with a vast expansion of a public education resulting in a wider reading public, resulted in dramatic changes in society. Because of the changes in society and technology, it was possible to earn a living as a writer, but it was often precarious at best, due to the ever-shifting tastes of the public, the format of the printed works, and the vested interests of critics and taste-makers.\n\nIn the end, the abstemious and idealistic writer, Reardon, dies with what looks a lot like a terminal case of writer\u2019s block. The literary critic, Albert Yule, and his daughter turned research assistant and amanuensis, goes blind and have mad with paranoia, resentment, and general bile. The starving innovator, Harold Biffen, seeks to explore a new sub-genre of realism that profiles the \u201cignobly decent\u201d in his great work, Mr. Baily, Grocer. A complete commercial flop, the profoundly discouraged Biffen ultimately commits suicide by taking poison. The Machiavellian writer and aspiring critic \/ editor Jasper Millvain succeeds, as does Reardon\u2019s widow, Amy, who marries Jasper after her husband\u2019s death. \n\nIn New Grub Street, the large cast of characters have interweaving, complex lives, as they attempt immortality through writing. Gissing suggests that their goals are ultimately nihilistic, for the same technology which makes possible mass production and mass distribution of published works also makes them invisible in the ever intensifying tides and surges of new waves of printed paper, much of which is never read.\n","reviewtitle":"Extreme Naturalism \/ Nihilism for the \"Ignobly Decent\"","reviewer":"susan smith nash","reviewdate":"2014-08-04 07:25:38","stars":"5"}]},
