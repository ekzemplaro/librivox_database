"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":3,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This book, following our hero from Deathworld, is a nice little adventure in to primative slavery. I also liked how the primative technology, coveted by the painfully ignorant natives, plays a major role in the story. \n\nReader Gregg Margarite also does an excellent job, and without him it would not be as good a book. His voice portrays very well the \"cool headed\" main character's voice and thoughts.\n\nEnjoy!","reviewtitle":"A nice follow up on our hero!","reviewer":"Pyrodin123321","reviewdate":"2010-02-10 19:05:58","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"Here's another good sci-fi and continuing adventures for our psi-hero, Jason Dinalt.\n\nJason is captured by a man who says he is guilty of crimes and must die for those crimes.  Jason, being the smart fellow he is, manages to trick the fellow and crash the ship on a strange planet.  Both are captured by locals and turned into slaves.  \n\nJason sizes up the planet and its culture, and figures out how to get out of the mess. But for some odd reason he feels the need to save his foolish captor, who feels the need to thwart Jason at every turn!  \n\nCan Jason figure out a way to get out of this mess and get back to his adopted Pyrrus? Will the Pyrrians get the chance to give the captor the thumping he so richly deserves?  \n\nYou will love this book, top to bottom.  Gregg does a great job, as usual.  Enjoy!","reviewtitle":"Neat story","reviewer":"mikezane","reviewdate":"2010-12-22 18:47:22","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This book is a fast moving, never dull page turner.   The hero is hunted by a \"do gooder\" who wants to \"bring him in\" for a trial and a first class hanging all in the name of what is right.  Of course, the hero can't let himself be executed and so the ride begins.  The story is lots of fun and never slow.\n\nThe narrator does a very good job and has narrated a bunch of scifi books on Libivox.  My only criticism (which really isn't one at all) is that his voice hits some very deep notes that make my car speakers rattle!\n\nTry the book.
