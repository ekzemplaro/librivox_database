Read by Joy Chan.\n\nIt is under a deep impression that the place and power of prayer in the Christian life is too little understood, that this book has been written. I feel sure that as long as we look on prayer chiefly as the means of maintaining our own Christian life, we shall not know fully what it is meant to be. But when we learn to regard it as the highest part of the work entrusted to us, the root and strength of all other work, we shall see that there is nothing that we so need to study and practise as the art of praying aright. ... the Father waits to hear every prayer of faith, to give us whatsoever we will, and whatsoever we ask in Jesus\u2019 name. (Andrew Murray, quoted from the Preface of this book)\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2009-02-07"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; religion; prayer; andrew murray"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-02-07 21:50:26"],"addeddate":["2009-02-07 17:41:03"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-02-07 21:53:26","2009-02-08 00:05:12"]},
