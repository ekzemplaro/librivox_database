(1843-1930) \n\nSome years ago, the editor of an English magazine sent a communication to \"the hundred greatest men in Great Britain\" asking them this question: \"If for any reason you were to spend a year absolutely alone, in a prison for instance, and could select from your library three volumes to be taken with you as companions in your period of retirement please to inform us what those three books would be.\" The inquiry was sent to peers of the realm, prominent leaders in politics, judges, authors, manufacturers, merchants, gentlemen of leisure\u2014men who would represent every aspect of successful life. In the answers it was found that ninety-eight of the hundred men named \"The Bible\" first on the list of the three books to be chosen.
