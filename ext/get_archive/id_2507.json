Read by Rick Rodstrom.\n\nBig, fat, dumb, lazy, vain, headstrong and cheap, Jack Keefe is a journeyman pitcher with the Chicago White Sox in the rowdy days of the Deadball Era, circa 1915, ruled by the likes of Ty Cobb and John McGraw. In You Know Me Al, we follow Jack Keefe's life on-field and off, via the letters Jack writes to his old chum Al in his home town of Bedford, Indiana.\n\nRing Lardner was a Chicago sportswriter who covered the White Sox, and he brought an insider's knowledge of clubhouse life together with his biting wit and gift for the vernacular to create a comic gem in You Know Me Al. The six Jack Keefe stories that compose this volume were originally written as individual magazine articles, but the epistolary format made it easy to collect them into a single running narrative covering Jack's first two years in the Big Leagues.\n\nIt isn't necessary to know baseball history to enjoy the book, which is as much about Jack's troubles with girlfriends, wives and babies as it is about the Chicago White Sox. For the baseball fan, however, this glimpse into a bygone era adds an extra layer of fascination. In any case, Lardner's portrait of the professional ballplayer as a dumb, drunken narcissist is as funny today as the day it was written. (Summary by Rick Rodstrom)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/you-know-me-al-by-ring-lardner\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>."],"date":["2009-08-30"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["Librivox; audiobook; baseball; epistolary fiction; Chicago White Sox; Deadball Era"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-08-29 21:17:11"],"addeddate":["2009-08-29 20:44:04"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-08-30 07:42:01","2011-06-17 07:24:51","2011-11-01 07:07:20","2011-12-01 06:35:41"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"runtime":["5:07:08"]},
