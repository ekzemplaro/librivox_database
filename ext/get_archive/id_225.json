Many of the poems appearing in <em>Songs of Innocence<\/em> have a counterpart in <em>Songs of Experience<\/em>, with quite a different perspective of the world.\n\nThe disastrous end of the French Revolution caused Blake to lose faith in the goodness of mankind, explaining much of the despair found in <em>Songs of Experience<\/em>. Blake also believed that children lost their innocence through exploitation and from a religious community which put dogma before mercy. He did not, however, believe that children should be kept from becoming experienced entirely. In truth, he believed that children should indeed become experienced but through their own discoveries, which is reflected in a number of these poems.<br \/>(Summary adapted from Wikipedia by Annie Coleman)\n\nFor more information on our readers, see our catalog page: <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/songs-of-innocence-and-experience-by-william-blake\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/librivox.org\/songs-of-innocence-and-experience-by-william-blake\/<\/a>\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; literature; poetry"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-02-28 22:20:45"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-02-28 22:26:25","2011-04-19 01:45:17","2011-04-19 01:47:08"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140320170557[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020515"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},
