St. Ambrose, esteeming very highly the dignity of the ministerial office, was most desirous that the clergy of his diocese should live worthily of their high vocation, and be good and profitable examples to the people. The language of the book is eloquent, the style noble, the thought abundant in both imagery and rhetoric, and the philosophical and moral contents - pithy, fragrant and heart-commanding.  \n(Summary by Euthymius)\n\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/on_duties_of_clergy_librivox\/OnTheDutiesOfTheClergy_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (238MB)<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox;  literature;  audiobook; Saint Ambrose; Bishop of Milan; Church Fathers; religion; Duties of the Clergy; clergy"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2007-06-06 15:16:33"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2007-06-06 15:25:29","2007-06-06 21:01:23","2011-10-13 05:02:00"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140326131344[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020414"],"runtime":["8:42:55"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"]},
