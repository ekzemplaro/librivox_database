It discusses things like unity of plot, reversal of situation, and character in the context of Greek tragedy, comedy and epic poetry. But it still applies today. It is especially popular with screenwriters as seen in many script gurus' how-to books.<br \/>(Summary by Robert Foster)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/poetics-by-aristotle\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/poetics_librivox\/PoeticsByAristotle64kbps_librivox.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (34MB)<\/a>"],"subject":["librivox; audiobook; literature; poetry"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-03-05 21:30:59"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-03-05 21:31:18","2006-03-06 18:36:46","2009-01-09 21:10:52","2009-01-16 21:31:19","2010-05-18 06:46:11"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140314080409[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020016"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"],"runtime":["2:23:49"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry"]},

His work is what the idea of a community of volunteers is all about. I must say that the more I listened to him the more he earned my respect for his efforts. Like him, I don't know Greek--although I can tell when someone is pronouncing it right. At one point he says, \"the blank of blank\". This is a wise decision.\n\nInitially his voice is a bit gravely and he has a bit of an accent that is unfamiliar to me. I wasn't certain I wanted to listen. That would have been a mistake. Overall, it's a good reading.\n\nGood job, Robert, and thanks for making the recording.","reviewtitle":"Gives it a good shot, does a good job.","reviewer":"Donald R Miller","reviewdate":"2013-11-12 13:10:27","stars":"3"}]},
