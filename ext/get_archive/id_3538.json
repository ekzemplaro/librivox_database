Read by Lee Ann Howlett.\n\nNancy 'Nance' Olden, a young and very pretty woman, is an accomplished liar and thief. Raised in a horrific orphanage, called the Cruelty by its occupants, Nance and her criminal boyfriend, Tom Dorgan, are pulling a con when the book begins. The results of their act propel Nance into a series of events that she could never have imagined. This was Miriam Michelson's first novel and it was considered a 'blockbuster' in its day. Ranked fourth on the list of bestsellers of 1904 by \"Publishers Weekly,\" Michelson's book was a source of controversy due to the dubious ethics and morals of its heroine. (Summary by Lee Ann Howlett)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/in-the-bishops-carriage-by-miriam-michelson\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks_14\/BishopsCarriage.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (151MB)<\/a>"],"date":["2010-01-19"],"year":["2010"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; fiction; mystery"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2010-01-20 01:56:47"],"addeddate":["2010-01-20 01:26:31"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2010-01-20 02:12:58"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140321054408[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020315"]},
