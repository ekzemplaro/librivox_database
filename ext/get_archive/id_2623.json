Read by Rachel Lintern.\n\nThis novel is subtitled <i>The Mellstock Quire, A Rural Painting of the Dutch School<\/i>. The Quire is the group of musicians who accompany the hymns at the local church and we follow the fortunes of one member, Dick Dewy, who falls in love with the new school mistress, Fancy Day. \n\nAnother element of the book is the battle between the traditional musicians of the Quire and the local vicar, Parson Maybold, who installs a church organ. This battle illustrates the developing technology being introduced in the Victorian era and its threat to traditional country ways. \n\nThe novel was published anonymously in 1872 and is often seen as Thomas Hardy's most gentle and pastoral novel. In 2005 Under the Greenwood Tree was adapted for a television version by Ashley Pharoah. (Summary by Rachel Lintern)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/under-the-greenwood-tree-by-thomas-hardy\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks4\/UnderGreenwoodTree_32kb.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook available<\/a>"],"date":["2009-02-13"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; fiction; romance; pastoral; choir; quire; music"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-02-12 23:16:15"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2009-02-13 14:22:49","2009-02-13 14:26:28","2010-09-18 21:14:14"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140311040826[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020508"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":2,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"This charming portrayal of a picturesque rural society, tinged with gentle humour and quiet irony, established Hardy as a writer. However, the novel is not merely a charming rural idyll. The double-plot, in which the love story of Dick Dewey and Fancy Day is inter-related with a tragic chapter in the history of Mellstock Choir, hints at the poignant disappearance of a long-lived and highly-valued traditional way of life.\nMany thanks to Mrs Lintern for her enlightened reading of Hardy\u2019s novel and bravo to Mrs Golding for her singing. The recording will no doubt delight all fans of classic British literature.","reviewtitle":"A perfect recording","reviewer":"Philippe Horak","reviewdate":"2009-04-05 06:05:57","stars":"5"},{"reviewbody":"This early Hardy novels is not very well known and is certainly not of the calibre or gravity of his later works.  But it is a delightful and fascinating tale nonetheless, and if you dislike the gloom of works like \"Jude the Obscure\" and \"Tess,\" you should find this a pleasant surprise.  The single reader is excellent all the way through the relatively short narrative.  She really seems to enjoy the characters, and that kind of empathy is what makes for a splendid audiobook!","reviewtitle":"Much to be recommended","reviewer":"Randall Curb","reviewdate":"2012-05-16 20:34:51","stars":"5"}]},
