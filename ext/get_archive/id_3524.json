Read by Martin Gleeson.\n\nPope\u2019s Essay on Man, a masterpiece of concise summary in itself, can fairly be summed up as an optimistic enquiry into mankind\u2019s place in the vast Chain of Being.\n\nEach of the poem\u2019s four Epistles takes a different perspective, presenting Man in relation to the universe, as individual, in society and, finally, tracing his prospects for achieving the goal of happiness.\n\nIn choosing stately rhyming couplets to explore his theme, Pope sometimes becomes obscure through compressing his language overmuch. By and large, the work is a triumphant exercise in philosophical poetry, communicating its broad and commonplace truths in superbly balanced phrases which remind us that Pope, alas, is one of the most quoted but least read writers in English:\n\n\u201cHope springs eternal in the human breast: Man never is, but always To be Blest.\u201d\n(Summary by Martin Geeson)\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"date":["2009-09-17"],"year":["2009"],"subject":["librivox; literature; audiobook; poetry; philosophy"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2009-09-17 22:31:40"],"addeddate":["2009-09-17 22:08:27"],"taper":["LibriVox Libr"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"updatedate":["2009-09-17 23:32:25"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"]},
"reviews":{"info":{"num_reviews":1,"avg_rating":"5.00"},"reviews":[{"reviewbody":"Martin Geeson, who has contributed his time and talents in enormous measure to Librivox projects, does an excellent job narrating Pope's \"An Essay on Man.\" He reads with great clarity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity \u2014 neither monotonous nor melodramatic, with perfect pronunciation, enunciation and phrasing indicative of an obviously deep and appreciative understanding of this poem.\n\nI suppose some listeners will be put off by Pope's extreme theodicy \u2014 and think immediately of Leibniz and Dr. Pangloss in Voltaire's \"Candide\" \u2014 but \"An Essay on Man\" is a jam-packed with famous phrases, wit, and historical significance. Thanks to Mr. Geeson's carefully nuanced reading, it is easy on the ears to listen to his recording repeatedly, which is useful since, whereas Pope is not really all that difficult, we are talking early 18th-Century English and a classic work densely packed with important philosophical ideas and allusions.","reviewtitle":"Geeson reads Pope superbly!","reviewer":"Joseph A.
