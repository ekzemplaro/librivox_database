This gave rise to a public dispute between the US Government and the United Nations about the level of fatalities caused by the attack and about whether those killed had been civilians or Taliban-linked insurgents. Allegations soon emerged that the attack had been based on false information deliberately fed to the US military by Afghan employees of ArmorGroup, a private security contractor, and that these employees were engaged in murder and anti-coalition activities. A key local contact of ArmorGroup, who they dubbed \"Mr Pink\", was subsequently convicted of espionage and sentenced to death, but was later freed.\n\nAccording to the committee's chair, Carl Levin, the investigation \"uncovered a significant amount of evidence that a number of security contractors working under Department of Defense contracts and subcontracts funneled US taxpayer dollars to Afghan warlords and strongmen linked to murder, kidnapping and bribery, as well as to Taliban and anti-coalition activities\".\n\n(Summary by Carl Manchester)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/private-security-contractors-in-afghanistan\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox catalog page<\/a> for this recording. \nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LibriVox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks1a\/ReportOfTheInquiryIntoTheRoleAndOversightOfPrivateSecurityContractorsInAfghanistan.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B format available<\/a>"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/"],"publicdate":["2012-01-27 16:13:24"],"addeddate":["2012-01-27 15:55:14"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2012-01-27 16:05:35","2012-01-27 17:42:41","2012-01-27 18:01:40"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140326022100[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020511"]},
