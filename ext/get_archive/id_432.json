It was the first children's title written by Margery Williams (1881 - 1944), who had previously created only for adults. This story eclipsed all others, to become her most famous work, and an ever adored classic for all ages.(Summary written by Marlo Dianne)\n\n\"It was by a sort of accident that The Velveteen Rabbit became the beginning of all the stories I have written sinceBy thinking about toys and remembering toys, they suddenly become very much alive. Toys I had loved as a little girl--my almost forgotten Tubby, who was the rabbit, and Old Dobbin, the Skin Horse, and the toys my children had loved.\" -- Margery Williams\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-velveteen-rabbit-by-margery-williams\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">catalog page<\/a> for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Librivox.org<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks_13\/velveteen_rabbit.m4b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download M4B (13MB)<\/a><br \/>"],"publicdate":["2006-03-28 20:55:33"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"creator":["Margery Williams"],"updatedate":["2006-03-28 21:01:24"],"updater":["librivoxbooks"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"],"curation":["[curator]malware@archive.org[\/curator][date]20140319071739[\/date][comment]checked for malware[\/comment]"],"boxid":["OL100020311"],"ppi":["600"],"ocr":["ABBYY FineReader 9.0"]},
