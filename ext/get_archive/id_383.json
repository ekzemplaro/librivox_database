James.\n\nMontague Rhodes James (1862-1936) was a medieval scholar; Provost of King's College, Cambridge. He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud in the long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural settings, with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities of supernatural forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories relying on a gentle, bucolic background to emphasise the awfulness of the otherworldly intrusions.\n\n\"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\" was written as two collections, presented here as two volumes in a single work. There is a short author's preface before the first story in each volume. (Summary by Peter Yearsley)\n\nRead by Peter Yearsley.\n\n<table cellpadding=\"10\"><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_Stories_of_an_Antiquary_1004.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_Stories_of_an_Antiquary_1004_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"book_title Thumbnail\" \/><\/a><\/td><td><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_antiquary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_antiquary_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"book_title Thumbnail\" \/><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_Stories_of_an_Antiquary_1004.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD booklet<\/a><\/span><br \/><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_Stories_of_an_Antiquary_1004.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Album Art<\/a><\/span><\/td><td><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_antiquary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CD booklet<\/a><\/span><br \/><span style=\"margin-left:55px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/ghost_stories_antiquary_librivox\/Ghost_antiquary.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Album Art<\/a><\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\n\nFor more information or to volunteer, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">librivox.org<\/a>.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.librivox.org\/index.php\/M4B_Catalog\" rel=\"nofollow\">M4B audiobook of Complete Book<\/a>"],"date":["2006-06-07"],"year":["2006"],"subject":["librivox;audiobooks;ghost stories;literature"],"licenseurl":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/"],"publicdate":["2006-06-07 09:34:16"],"updater":["librivoxbooks","ARossi","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks","librivoxbooks"],"updatedate":["2006-06-07 23:37:28","2006-06-09 17:37:21","2009-10-22 14:40:35","2009-12-24 10:31:53","2010-05-27 02:30:07"],"taper":["LibriVox"],"source":["Librivox recording of a public-domain text"],"runtime":["10:06:39"],"collection":["librivoxaudio","audio_bookspoetry","opensource_audio"]},

I have listened to these performances over and over for weeks.  I obtained a separate M.R. James volume from the local library because of them (and a comment from Poppy Z. Brite). Please, Mr. Yearsley, could your operatively defined largesse include very seriously considering reading, as soon as would fit your schedule[s], some public domain equivalent of Thomas Ligotti? And, again, at your earliest opportunity? I'll do the footwork on that, if you only ask, and then present those members belonging to the union of both sets, 'public domain' and 'of a Thomas Ligotti 'mezzotint'. ---------------------------------------------------\nMezzotint \\Mez\"zo*tint\\, n.
