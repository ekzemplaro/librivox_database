{"books":{"17":{"id":"8741","title":"Postmaster's Daughter","description":"A charming mystery story set in the early 1900s which is as much about the townspeople, sleuths and other\ncolorful characters as it is about the murder. Filled with comic antics of Scotland Yard fellows, local police, and residents\nof the town, keeps the murder ever elusive. The \"whodunit\" is maintained until the very end and the laughter keeps\ngoing even after the mystery is solved.
