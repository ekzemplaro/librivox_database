{"books":{"7":{"id":"2409","title":"Appetite of Tyranny","description":"<p>\u201cUnless we are all mad, there is at the back of the most bewildering business a story: and if we are all mad, there is no such thing as madness. If I set a house on fire, it is quite true that I may illuminate many other people's weaknesses as well as my own. It may be that the master of the house was burned because he was drunk; it may be that the mistress of the house was burned because she was stingy, and perished arguing about the expense of the fire-escape. It is, nevertheless, broadly true that they both were burned because I set fire to their house. That is the story of the thing. The mere facts of the story about the present European conflagration are quite as easy to tell.\" (Summary by Gilbert Keith Chesterton)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/11605","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2409","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/appetite_of_tyranny_rc_0808\/appetite_of_tyranny_rc_0808_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/appetite-of-tyranny-by-g-k-chesterton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:07:22","totaltimesecs":7642,"authors":[{"id":"426","first_name":"G.
