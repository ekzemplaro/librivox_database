{"books":[{"id":"9579","title":"Bible (KJV) Book 8: Ruth (Dramatic Reading)","description":"The Book of Ruth in the Bible takes a new interpretation as it comes to life in this dramatic reading. Ruth, a young Moabitess whose husband dies, must make the decision to stay in her homeland or go with her mother-in-law Naomi back to Naomi\u2019s homeland of Israel, where she will most likely be an outcast. Will she choose to go back to her gods and old lifestyle, or follow her love for her mother-in-law and learn about a new God and way of life?
