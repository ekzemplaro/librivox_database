{"books":{"14":{"id":"3227","title":"Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich","description":"\"Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich\" is a work of humorous fiction by Stephen Leacock first published in 1914. It is the follow-up to his 1912 classic \"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town.\" Like that work, it is a sequence of interlocking stories set in one town, but instead of focusing on a small Canadian town in the countryside, it is set in a major American metropolis and its characters are the upper crust of society. <br \/><br \/>Although currently not as well-known as the earlier book, \"Arcadian Adventures\" was extremely popular in North America at the time of its publication and for a while was considered the greater success. It was also translated and published by the Bolshevik government soon after the 1917 revolution and it became a bestseller in the Soviet Union.
