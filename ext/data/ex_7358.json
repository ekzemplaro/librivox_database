{"books":{"48":{"id":"7358","title":"Kings and Queens of England with Other Poems","description":"I must claim the indulgence of my friends for the many defects they will find in my poems, which they will please wink at, remembering that I was sixty years old when I commenced rhyming; and this by way of experiment, while on a visit to my daughter, in Brooklyn.\nMy first essay, was The Monarchs of England. I took it up for my amusement, wishing to ascertain how much of that history I could recollect without help from any other source than memory. The rhyme is in many places far from smooth, and there are many redundances that might with advantage be lopped off; and were it to come under the critic\u2019s eye to be reviewed, I should feel it quite necessary to improve it, (the poetry, I mean.)\nBut as it would require quite too much exertion for my eyes in their present state, and as the history, dates, &c., I believe, are correct, I send it to the press \u201cwith all its imperfections on its head.\u201d (Summary from Preface) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/14955","language":"English","copyright_year":"1853","num_sections":"49","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7358","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"https:\/\/forum.librivox.org\/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=43595","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"6155","first_name":" Mary Ann H.
