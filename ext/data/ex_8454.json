{"books":{"25":{"id":"8454","title":"Romance of a Mummy and Egypt","description":"The account he gives, in his novel, of the ancient city of Thebes, of the great necropolis in the valley of Biban el Mol\u00fbk, of the subterranean tombs, of the precautions taken by the designers to baffle curiosity, of the form and ornamentation of the sarcophagi, of the mummy-cases, of the mummy itself, of the manners, customs, dress, and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, are marvellously accurate. XXX The purely erudite part of the work would probably not have interested the general public, indifferent to the discoveries of arch\u00e6ology, but the introduction of the human element of love at once captivated it; the erudite appreciated the accuracy of the restoration of ancient times and manners; the merely curious were pleased with a well told story, cleverly set in a framework whose strangeness appealed to their love of exoticism and novelty. XXXX There have been added by the editor, as bearing upon the subject of the \"Romance of a Mummy,\" two or three chapters from the volume entitled \"The Orient,\" which is made up of a collection of sketches and letters of travel written at different times, and of reviews of books upon Eastern subjects, whether modern or ancient. - Summary by (Treanslator F.
