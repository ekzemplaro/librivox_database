{"books":{"19":{"id":"9915","title":"Land of Beyond","description":"Robert William Service was a British-Canadian poet and writer who has often been called \"the Bard of the Yukon\".  He is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, Songs of a Sourdough (1907). His vivid descriptions of the Yukon and its people made it seem that he was a veteran of the Klondike gold rush, instead of the late-arriving bank clerk he actually was. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/service1.html#beyond","language":"English","copyright_year":"1912","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9915","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"322","first_name":"Robert W.","last_name":"Service","dob":"1874","dod":"1958"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"341003","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341004","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341005","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341006","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341007","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341008","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341009","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341010","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341011","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341012","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341013","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341014","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341015","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341016","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341017","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341018","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341019","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341020","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341021","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341022","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
