{"books":{"16":{"id":"7320","title":"Spiritual Life","description":"In this book, Andrew Murray explores the dynamics of the Christian life as Jesus means it to be lived. He explains how the Holy Spirit is essential to living effectively as a believer. Christians are often all too well aware of the feebleness of their life and testimony. This most encouraging book, consisting of a series of lectures given to students at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago in 1895, shows how the working of the Holy Spirit in the Christian\u2019s life makes all the difference. It shows how God\u2019s power is made perfect in weakness, and how His Holy Spirit may animate and renew every area of the believer\u2019s life.
