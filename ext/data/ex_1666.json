{"books":{"1":{"id":"1666","title":"Aphorisms","description":"In 1894, Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900) published two collections of aphorisms:  \"A Few Maxims For The Instruction Of The Over-Educated\", in the Saturday Review newspaper, and Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young\", in the Oxford student magazine The Chameleon. By turns witty, intellectual, counter-intuitive and obtruse, the collections came to be seen by many as emblematic of Wilde's style, and countless collections of Wildean aphorisms have since been published.
