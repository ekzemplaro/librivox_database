{"books":{"18":{"id":"10707","title":"Roosevelt Bears","description":"\"The Roosevelt Bears - Their Travels and Adventures\" is full of fun as we follow the journeys and mishaps of two big, delightful bears. Tired of life in the West of America and eager to see places of which they had only heard, Teddy-B and Teddy-G head east. All ages will laugh and enjoy the antics told in lively rhyme - whether riding a train, donkey, balloon or boat, running a farm, attending school, or (oh, no!)... sitting in jail.  - Summary by
