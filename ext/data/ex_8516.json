{"books":{"19":{"id":"8516","title":"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds Volume 2","description":"This history of mass folly, first published in 1841, chronicles the consequences of questionable popular movements on social order and individual psyches. Mackay, a Scottish journalist and poet, wrote in a witty and sensational style as he debunked such delusion-based orchestrations as the Crusades, witch-hunts, the use of slow-working poisons as tools for murder, belief in haunted houses, popular admiration of thieves, the belief in and worhsip of relics as authentic items, and much more. His work is considered by many academics today a valuable commentary on crowd psychology.  - Summary by Nathan Dickey","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/24518","language":"English","copyright_year":"1852","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8516","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4709","first_name":" Charles","last_name":"Mackay","dob":"1812","dod":"1889"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"301735","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301736","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301737","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301738","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301739","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301740","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301741","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301742","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301743","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301744","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301745","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301746","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301747","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301748","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301749","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301750","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301751","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301752","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301753","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]},{"id":"301754","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7912","display_name":"Nathan Dickey"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"100","name":"Psychology"}],"translators":[]}}}
