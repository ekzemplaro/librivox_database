{"books":{"9":{"id":"5184","title":"By Ox Team to California - A Narrative of Crossing the Plains in 1860","description":"Imagine a young, twenty-something woman in 1860, reared \u201cin the indolent life of the ordinary Southern girl\u201d (which means she has never learned to cook); married to a professional man who knows \u201cnothing of manual labor;\u201d who is mother to a young son; and who has just found out she is pregnant with their second child. Imagine that this couple has become \u201cembarrassed financially\u201d by \u201cimprudent speculations,\u201d and that they are discussing what to do. They decide to buy a wagon and three yoke of unbroken oxen and head overland to California.<br><br>\"We were two such precious dunces,\u201d writes Lavinia Honeyman Porter in her autobiographical account of their journey across the plains. \u201cIn a short time the six oxen were bought, driven to our home and turned loose in our barnyard--wild brutes, as handy as with their heels as with their horns. Not one of us was brave enough to venture into the corral with them and we soon concluded we had six white elephants on our hands.\u201d From there on in, Lavinia's adventures get worse\u2014and then better.  For those who enjoy true stories of pioneering days and happy endings, this is an enjoyable read.<br>(Introduction by Sue Anderson)<br\/><br\/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/byoxteamtocalifo00port","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5184","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ox_team_california_sa_librivox\/ox_team_california_sa_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/by-ox-team-to-california-by-lavinia-honeyman-porter\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:52:01","totaltimesecs":17521,"authors":[{"id":"1810","first_name":"Lavinia Honeyman","last_name":"Porter","dob":"1836","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/ox_team_california_sa_librivox","sections":[{"id":"57624","section_number":"0","title":"0 - Dedication & Introductory","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"336","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57625","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Preparations; Camping in Kansas","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2109","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57626","section_number":"2","title":"2 - Fire & Fuel; Buffalo Country","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1654","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57627","section_number":"3","title":"3 - Indians; Trials of the Spirit","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2049","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57628","section_number":"4","title":"4 - A Sale of Glassware; On to California","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1829","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57629","section_number":"5","title":"5 - The Rocky Mountains; Shoeing Lame Oxen","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1735","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57630","section_number":"6","title":"6 - The Overland Road; Money Giving Out","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1516","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57631","section_number":"7","title":"7 - Discarded Possessions; Salt Lake City","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2088","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57632","section_number":"8","title":"8 - Graves in the Desert; Climbing the Sierras","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2360","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"57633","section_number":"9","title":"9 - Descending into California; The Journey's End","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1845","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"},{"id":"111","name":"Memoirs"}],"translators":[]}}}
