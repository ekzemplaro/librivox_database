{"books":{"2":{"id":"7994","title":"Legend of Sleepy Hollow (version 3)","description":"Everyone knows the story of the Headless Horseman but perhaps you, like me, did not remember what a marvelous story teller Washington Irving was.  He observed human nature closely and like any good humorist, lets us laugh at our own silly and superstitious sides through the joy of having strangers be the ones to display them. If you, like me, have only vague and muddy memories of this story, you owe it to yourself to listen and laugh along with the rest of the world. My High School English teacher who could never interest me in 'literature', would be proud. <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/41","language":"English","copyright_year":"1820","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7994","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/legendofsleepyhollow_pc_librivox\/legendofsleepyhollow_pc_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-legend-of-sleepy-hollow-by-washington-irving-3\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:25:05","totaltimesecs":5105,"authors":[{"id":"1743","first_name":"Washington","last_name":"Irving","dob":"1783","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/legendofsleepyhollow_pc_librivox","sections":[{"id":"120933","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1578","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"120934","section_number":"2","title":"2  - Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1636","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"120935","section_number":"3","title":"3 - Part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1891","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"}],"translators":[]}}}
