{"books":{"39":{"id":"10235","title":"Christmas Stories From 'Household Words' And 'All The Year Round'","description":"Twenty Christmas stories originally published in the Christmas editions of the magazines \u201cHousehold Words\u201d and \u201cAll The Year Round\u201d. Some of the stories have little holiday sentiment and exhibit much of the indignation Dickens felt at the social and economic injustices of his day. Some of the stories were written in collaboration with other authors. The editor of this volume chose to omit those other chapters and include only Dickens' work. The result is that some of the stories are a bit choppy, not to say confusing.
