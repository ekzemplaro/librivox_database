It is attributed to the Hindu sage Valmiki and forms an important part of the Hindu canon (sm\u1e5bti). The Ramayana is one of the two great epics of India, the other being Mahabharata. It is the story of Rama, who embarks on an epic journey followed by the fight with Ravana, the demon king who abducted Rama's wife, Sita. The epic depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal wife and the ideal king. Book 5 of Rmayan, also known as Sundara Kanda is the heart of Valmiki's Ramayana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of Hanuman's adventures as he moves to Lanka in search of Sita.
