{"books":{"15":{"id":"5232","title":"Little Colonel's House Party","description":"Lloyd Sherman, the \"Little Colonel\", is a girl of eleven whose mother invites three other girls to spend a month with Lloyd in her beautiful home in Kentucky. The children come from very different homes, but fall into the new ways very readily. The account of their escapades will amuse young readers. A bit of disobedience on the part of one spoilt girl leads to something of a tragedy, in which Betty, the nicest of the children, is the sufferer.<br><br> This series for girls from the early 1900\u2019s, begun in \u201cThe Little Colonel\u201d, and continued in \u201cThe Gate of the Giant Scissors\u201d and \u201cTwo Little Knights of Kentucky\u201d, is picked up again in this volume, with the return of several of the characters from those books.
