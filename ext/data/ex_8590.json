{"books":{"15":{"id":"8590","title":"In The Days of Giants","description":"This book is made of the stories told by the Northern folk,\u2014the people who live in the land of the midnight sun, where summer is green and pleasant, but winter is a terrible time of cold and gloom; where rocky mountains tower like huge giants, over whose heads the thunder rolls and crashes, and under whose feet are mines of precious metals. Therefore you will find the tales full of giants and dwarfs,\u2014spirits of the cold mountains and dark caverns.\nYou will find the hero to be Thor, with his thunderbolt hammer, who dwells in the happy heaven of Asgard, where All-Father Odin is king, and where Balder the beautiful makes springtime with his smile. In the north countries, winter, cold, and frost are very real and terrible enemies; while spring, sunshine, and warmth are near and dear friends. So the story of the Beginning of Things is a story of cold and heat, of the wicked giants who loved the cold, and of the good \u00c6sir, who basked in pleasant warmth. - Summary by the author","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/44622","language":"English","copyright_year":"1902","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8590","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"153","first_name":"Abbie Farwell","last_name":"Brown","dob":"1871","dod":"1927"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"303498","section_number":"1","title":"The Beginning of Things","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_01_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9227","display_name":"Arup Sen"}]},{"id":"303499","section_number":"2","title":"How Odin Lost His Eye","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_02_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8720","display_name":"Richard Corfield"}]},{"id":"303500","section_number":"3","title":"Kvasir's Blood","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_3_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8720","display_name":"Richard Corfield"}]},{"id":"303501","section_number":"4","title":"The Giant Builder","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_04_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8780","display_name":"Miyune"}]},{"id":"303502","section_number":"5","title":"The Magic Apples","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9227","display_name":"Arup Sen"}]},{"id":"303503","section_number":"6","title":"Skadi's Choice","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_6_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9051","display_name":"Megan Carmichael"}]},{"id":"303504","section_number":"7","title":"The Dwarf's Gifts","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_07_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8923","display_name":"Sarah Terry"}]},{"id":"303505","section_number":"8","title":"Loki's Children","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_08_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8923","display_name":"Sarah Terry"}]},{"id":"303506","section_number":"9","title":"The Quest of the Hammer","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8948","display_name":"troykemp"}]},{"id":"303507","section_number":"10","title":"The Giantess Who Would Not","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9227","display_name":"Arup Sen"}]},{"id":"303508","section_number":"11","title":"Thor's Visit to the Giants","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"303509","section_number":"12","title":"Thor's Fishing","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"303510","section_number":"13","title":"Thor's Duel","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"303511","section_number":"14","title":"In the Giant's House","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"303513","section_number":"15","title":"The Punishment of Loki","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_16_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8923","display_name":"Sarah Terry"}]},{"id":"303512","section_number":"16","title":"Balder and the Mistletoe","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/inthedaysofgiants_15_brown.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8923","display_name":"Sarah Terry"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"39","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
