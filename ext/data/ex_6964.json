{"books":{"4":{"id":"6964","title":"Poems: Series Two","description":"\"The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes,\u2014life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch,\" as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power. This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.\" (Summary by Mabel Loomis Todd, from Preface)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2679","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6964","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/poems_seriestwo_la_librivox\/poems_seriestwo_la_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/poems-series-two-by-emily-dickinson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:39:59","totaltimesecs":5999,"authors":[{"id":"23","first_name":"Emily","last_name":"Dickinson","dob":"1830","dod":"1886"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/poems_seriestwo_la_librivox","sections":[{"id":"104886","section_number":"0","title":"0 - Preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"401","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7245","display_name":"Laura Atkinson"}]},{"id":"104887","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Life","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1729","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7245","display_name":"Laura Atkinson"}]},{"id":"104888","section_number":"2","title":"2 - Love","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"545","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7245","display_name":"Laura Atkinson"}]},{"id":"104889","section_number":"3","title":"3 - Nature","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1896","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7245","display_name":"Laura Atkinson"}]},{"id":"104890","section_number":"4","title":"4 - Time and Eternity","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1428","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7245","display_name":"Laura Atkinson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"63","name":"Single author"}],"translators":[]}}}
