{"books":{"34":{"id":"10792","title":"Strange Story Book","description":"A collection of stories compiled by the widow of the renowned children's short-story collector, Andrew Lang. She describes this is the final installment of his series of fairy stories and includes some of those stories he had not included in other collections. In the preface, she pays tribute to her husband, saying he liked old things more than new, he loved all beasts' because they were beasts', fairies, cricket and dancing. He longed to visit far away places, but hated to travel. But most of all he befriended children wherever he went and they shared stories with him. Only his own children mocked him. - Summary by Lynne
