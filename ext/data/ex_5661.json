{"books":{"11":{"id":"5661","title":"Bible (KJV) 26: Ezekiel","description":"The book of Ezekiel follows the southern kingdom of Israel, Judah, into captivity by the Babylonians. Ezekiel cries judgement on the Israelites for their sins, but also sings of God's mercy and the ultimate salvation of His people. Aside from its Judeo-Christian truths, the powerful imagery and poetry found throughout the book make for an interesting study in ancient literature.
