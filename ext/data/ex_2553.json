{"books":{"9":{"id":"2553","title":"Soup of Alphabets, Volume 003","description":"<p>This third \"stove-top\" full of Alphabet Soups --again-- runs the fullest gamut! It ranges from country scenes (Alphabets of Fruits, Birds, Animals and \"Country Scenes\"), to just plain silliness (Absurd ABCs and Lear's Nonsense Alphabet #5), and finally, topical subjects (the Anti-Slavery Alphabet, the Alphabet of Celebrities --a list quite different when compared to our current crew-- and an Alphabet of Old Testament History). Have fun, and be sure to tune in for the fourth volume, which promises to break new ground in Alphabet Books!
