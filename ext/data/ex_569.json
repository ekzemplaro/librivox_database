{"books":{"20":{"id":"569","title":"Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things","description":"<p>Most of the following Kwaidan, or Weird Tales, have been taken from old Japanese books,\u2014 such as the Yaso-Kidan, Bukkyo-Hyakkwa-Zensho, Kokon-Chomonshu, Tama-Sudare, and Hyaku-Monogatari. Some of the stories may have had a Chinese origin: the very remarkable \"Dream of Akinosuke,\" for example, is certainly from a Chinese source. But the story-teller, in every case, has so recolored and reshaped his borrowing as to naturalize it\u2026 One queer tale, \"Yuki-Onna,\" was told me by a farmer of Chofu, Nishitama-gori, in Musashi province, as a legend of his native village. Whether it has ever been written in Japanese I do not know; but the extraordinary belief which it records used certainly to exist in most parts of Japan, and in many curious forms\u2026 The incident of \"Riki-Baka\" was a personal experience; and I wrote it down almost exactly as it happened, changing only a family-name mentioned by the Japanese narrator.
