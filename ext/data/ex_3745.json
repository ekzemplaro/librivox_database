{"books":{"10":{"id":"3745","title":"Gitanjali","description":"Gitanjali is a collection of 103 poems in English, largely translations by the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. This volume became very famous in the West, and was widely translated into other languages. In England a slender volume was published in 1913, with an exhilarating preface by W. B. Yeats. In the same year, Rabindranath became the first non-European to win the Nobel prize. (summary by Hilara)\n\n\"On many an idle day have I grieved over lost time. But it is never lost, my lord. Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands.\n\nHidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness.\n\nI was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had ceased. In the morning I woke up and found my garden full with wonders of flowers.\" 81, Gitanjali ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/en.wikisource.org\/wiki\/Gitanjali","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3745","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/gitanjali_1002_librivox\/gitanjali_1002_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gitanjali","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/gitanjali-by-rabindranath-tagore\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:40:33","totaltimesecs":6033,"authors":[{"id":"568","first_name":"Rabindranath","last_name":"Tagore","dob":"1861","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/gitanjali_1002_librivox","sections":[{"id":"18862","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"871","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3588","display_name":"Neeru Iyer"}]},{"id":"18863","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Verses 1 to 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"430","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3588","display_name":"Neeru Iyer"}]},{"id":"18864","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Verses 11 to 20","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"480","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4153","display_name":"Hilara"}]},{"id":"18865","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Verses 21 to 30","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"416","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4153","display_name":"Hilara"}]},{"id":"18866","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Verses 31 to 40","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"413","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3885","display_name":"Elli"}]},{"id":"18867","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Verses 41 to 50","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"638","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4524","display_name":"lonely trotter"}]},{"id":"18868","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Verses 51 to 60","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"709","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4145","display_name":"Patti Cunningham"}]},{"id":"18869","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Verses 61 to 70","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"575","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4145","display_name":"Patti Cunningham"}]},{"id":"18870","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Verses 71 to 80","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"512","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"18871","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Verses 81 to 90","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"428","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3923","display_name":"Sean Michael Hogan"}]},{"id":"18872","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Verses 91 to 103","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"561","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3923","display_name":"Sean Michael Hogan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
