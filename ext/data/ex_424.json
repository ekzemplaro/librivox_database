{"books":{"11":{"id":"424","title":"Innocence of Father Brown","description":"<em>The Innocence of Father Brown<\/em> (1911) is the first of five collections of mystery stories by G. K. Chesterton starring an unimposing but surprisingly capable Roman Catholic priest. Father Brown's ability to uncover the truth behind the mystery continually surpasses that of the \"experts\" around him, who are fooled into underestimation by the priest's unimpressive outward appearance and, often, by their own prejudices about Christianity. Combining captivating stories and insightful commentary, <em>The Innocence of Father Brown<\/em> is a delightful read.
