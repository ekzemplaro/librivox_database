He campaigned vigorously against excessive drinking, appearing in pubs and bars to give edifying poems and speeches. These were very popular, the people of Dundee possibly recognising that McGonagall was &#8220;so giftedly bad he backed unwittingly into genius&#8221;. Six of those poems are recited here.<\/p>\n<p>(Summary collated from McGonagall&#8217;s verse and Wikipedia by Cori Samuel.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk\/poems\/temperance.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1902","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1949","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/temperance_gems_0804_librivox\/temperance_gems_0804_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/temperance-gems-by-william-mcgonagall\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:30:10","totaltimesecs":1810,"authors":[{"id":"511","first_name":"William Topaz","last_name":"McGonagall","dob":"1825","dod":"1902"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/temperance_gems_0804_librivox","sections":[{"id":"155667","section_number":"1","title":"The Rattling Boy from Dublin","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"264","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"150","display_name":"Fox in the Stars"}]},{"id":"155668","section_number":"2","title":"A Tribute to Mr Murphy and the Blue Ribbon Army","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"240","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"150","display_name":"Fox in the Stars"}]},{"id":"155669","section_number":"3","title":"The Destroying Angel or The Poet's Dream","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"349","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"150","display_name":"Fox in the Stars"}]},{"id":"155670","section_number":"4","title":"The Troubles of Matthew Mahoney","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"277","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"167","display_name":"Peter Yearsley"}]},{"id":"155671","section_number":"5","title":"The Demon Drink","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"347","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2481","display_name":"Alana Jordan"}]},{"id":"155672","section_number":"6","title":"A New Temperance Poem, in Memory of my Departed Parents","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"333","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2481","display_name":"Alana Jordan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
