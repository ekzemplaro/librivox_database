{"books":{"8":{"id":"8688","title":"History of Emily Montague Vol 1 (Dramatic Reading)","description":"The novel takes place 10 years after the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759 when Quebec becomes a British colony. Written as a collection of letters, the story follows the relationships between Edward Rivers (a British soldier), his friend, John Temple (rather a cad), Emily Montague (a young British woman), and her dearest friend, Arabella Fermor (a flirtatious drama queen). Giving glimpses into the new frontier discoveries of Canada, one not only peeks into the personal relationships of these characters but gets swept away by the enticing descriptions of the \"new world.\" This is Volume 1 out of 4. - Summary by Amanda Friday<br><br>\n<u>Characters:<\/u><br>\nEdward Rivers, read by <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/9406\">Kit Noussis<\/a><br>\nJohn Temple, read by <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/7170\">Alan Mapstone<\/a><br>\nArabella Fermor, read by <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/6544\">Amanda Friday<\/a><br>\nEmily Montague, read by <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/7138\">Caprisha Page<\/a><br>\nMrs. E.
