Henty\u2019s \u201ctale of ancient Egypt\u201d tells the story of Amuba, prince of the Rebu, who is taken captive when his people are conquered by the Egyptians, and then becomes the servant and companion of Chebron, son of the high priest of Osiris. A mystery unfolds as the lads find evidence of a murderous conspiracy within the ranks of the priesthood; but they must then flee for their lives when they unintentionally kill the cat selected as the successor to the Cat of Bubastes, one of the most sacred animals of Egypt. Amuba and Chebron are strong, courageous, and resourceful \u2013 but will this be enough to carry them beyond the long reach of the power of Egypt? (Summary by D. Leeson)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/29756","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3673","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/cat_bubastes_0912_librivox\/cat_bubastes_0912_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-cat-of-bubastes-by-g-a-henty\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:46:08","totaltimesecs":38768,"authors":[{"id":"287","first_name":"G.
