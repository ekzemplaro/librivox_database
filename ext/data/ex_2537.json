{"books":{"4":{"id":"2537","title":"Jumping Frog","description":"\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" is an 1865 short story by Mark Twain. It was also published as \"The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" and \"Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog.\" In it, the narrator retells a story he heard from a bartender, Simon Wheeler, at the Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, about the gambler Jim Smiley. Upon discovering a French translation of this story, Twain re-translated the story, word for word and keeping the French grammar structure, back into English. He then published all three versions under the title \"The Jumping Frog: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back Into A Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil.\" (Summary by Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/evolve.topcities.com\/jumping_frog_01.html","language":"Multilingual","copyright_year":"1903","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2537","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/jumping_frog_0810_librivox\/jumping_frog_0810_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Celebrated_Jumping_Frog_of_Calaveras_County","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-jumping-frog-by-mark-twain\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:05:11","totaltimesecs":3911,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/jumping_frog_0810_librivox","sections":[{"id":"167175","section_number":"0","title":"The Jumping Frog: In English, then in French, then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"253","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]},{"id":"167176","section_number":"1","title":"The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1079","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]},{"id":"167177","section_number":"2","title":"La Grenouille Sauteuse du Comt\u00e9 de Calaveras","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1006","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3060","display_name":"Didier"}]},{"id":"167178","section_number":"3","title":"The Frog Jumping of the County of Calaveras","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1019","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]},{"id":"167179","section_number":"4","title":"Private History of the \"Jumping Frog\" Story","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"554","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
