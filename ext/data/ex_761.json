{"books":{"30":{"id":"761","title":"Candide","description":"Candide, ou l\u2019Optimisme, (\u201cCandide, or Optimism\u201d) (1759) is a picaresque novel by the Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire. Voltaire never openly admitted to having written the controversial Candide; the work is signed with a pseudonym: \u201cMonsieur le docteur Ralph\u201d, literally \u201cMister Doctor Ralph.\u201dSardonic in outlook, it follows the na\u00efve protagonist Candide from his first exposure to the precept that \u201call is for the best in this, the best of all possible worlds,\u201d and on through a series of adventures that dramatically disprove that precept even as the protagonist clings to it.The novel satirizes na\u00efve interpretations of the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz and is a showcase of the horrors of the 18th century world. In Candide, Leibniz is represented by the philosopher Pangloss, the tutor of the title character. Despite a series of misfortunes and misadventures, which include being present at the Lisbon Earthquake, Pangloss continually asserts that \u201cTout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles\u201d (\u201cAll is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\u201d). The novel ends with Candide finally rejecting the optimism espoused by Pangloss, saying, \u201cIl faut cultiver notre jardin\u201d (\u201cIt is necessary to cultivate our garden\u201d).
