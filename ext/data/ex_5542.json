{"books":{"3":{"id":"5542","title":"Louis Lambert","description":"<br \/>Louis Lambert is an 1832 novel by French novelist and playwright Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (1799\u20131850), included in the \u00c9tudes philosophiques section of his novel sequence La Com\u00e9die humaine. Set mostly in a school at Vend\u00f4me, it examines the life and theories of a boy genius fascinated by the Swedish philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg (1688\u20131772).\n \nBalzac wrote Louis Lambert during the summer of 1832 while he was staying with friends at the Ch\u00e2teau de Sach\u00e9, and published three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the realist style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author\u2019s own childhood. Specific details and events from the author\u2019s life \u2013 including punishment from teachers and social ostracism \u2013 suggest a fictionalized autobiography.\n \nWhile he was a student at Vend\u00f4me, Balzac wrote an essay called Trait\u00e9 de la Volont\u00e9 (\u201dTreatise on the Will\u201d); it is described in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay and elsewhere in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.\n \nAlthough critics panned the novel, Balzac remained steadfast in his belief that it provided an important look at philosophy, especially metaphysics.
