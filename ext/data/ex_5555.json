The novel begins with the 1672 politically motivated mob lynching of the de Witt brothers and then follows the story of Cornelius van Baerle, godson of Cornelius de Wit.  Cornelius Van Baerle has joined the race to breed a truly black tulip \u2013 and to win the prize of 100,000 guilders, as well as fame and honour.
