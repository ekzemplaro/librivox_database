Her first collection of poems, Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems, was published that same year.\n\nTeasdale's second collection, Helen of Troy and Other Poems, was published in 1911.[2] It was well received by critics, who praised its lyrical mastery and romantic subject matter.\nTeasdale's third poetry collection, Rivers to the Sea, was published in 1915. It was and is a bestseller, being reprinted several times.\n\nIn 1918 she won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1917 poetry collection Love Songs. It was \"made possible by a special grant from The Poetry Society\"; however, the sponsoring organization now lists it as the earliest Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (inaugurated 1922). - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/591","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10718","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/the_wine_1603.poem_librivox\/the_wine_1603.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-wine-by-sara-teasdale\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:10:56","totaltimesecs":656,"authors":[{"id":"20","first_name":"Sara","last_name":"Teasdale","dob":"1884","dod":"1933"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/the_wine_1603.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"364969","section_number":"1","title":"The Wine -
