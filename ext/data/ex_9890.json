{"books":{"19":{"id":"9890","title":"Jesse James, My Father","description":"A biography of Jesse James as told by his son, Jesse James, Jr.  We are treated to inside tales of Jesse's childhood and home life; what drove him to become a Confederate guerrilla during the Civil War; his life after the war and how he became a wanted man.  Since it was written by his son, it is a little biased and we are not told anything about any crimes Jesse and his gang committed.  Some of the stories of Jesse's war adventures are a little hard to believe, but a good read nonetheless. - Summary by Barry
