{"books":{"27":{"id":"4747","title":"Sir Nigel","description":"By 1348 the House of Loring has fallen on hard times. Together, the Black Death and the greedy monks of Waverley have bled away all of the Loring wealth. Even the manor house will have to go to pay their debts.\r\nThen a chance encounter with the King of England provides Nigel, the last of the Lorings, with the chance to seek his fortune in the constant wars with France. But more importantly for Nigel it also means that he may be able to do the \"three small deeds\" that will show he is worthy to ask for the hand of the Lady Mary in marriage.\r\nFilled with chivalry, humour, and high romance, Sir Nigel is simply a rattling good yarn.\r\n(Summary by Clive Catterall)
