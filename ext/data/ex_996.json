{"books":{"17":{"id":"996","title":"Frenzied Fiction","description":"<p>From the cave man to Santa Claus; spies, know-it-alls, and journalists: all are fair game for Leacock\u2019s special brand of humor. He touches on the changes time has brought about in the city, education, and work habits. Among the other topics in this work are nature, fishing, gardening, success, and spirits--both of the departed and of the variety Prohibition prohibited.<\/p><p>Each chapter of this book is a standalone story and if you love a good laugh, these stories are for you. In me, Leacock\u2019s wit produced the full range of laughter: smiles, chuckles, guffaws, and some uncontrollable giggles. Also, occasionally, I found myself shedding a tear or two.
