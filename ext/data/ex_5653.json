This was the Weekly Poetry project for July 3, 2011.<br><br>Aldrich attended school  in Portsmouth to prepare for college. This period of his life is partly described in his semi-autobiographical novel [i]The Story of a Bad Boy[\/i] (1870), in which \"Tom Bailey\" is the juvenile hero. Critics have said that this novel contains the first realistic depiction of childhood in American fiction and prepared the ground for [i]Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.[\/i]<br>Nocturne was taken from the Yale Book of American Verse, edited by Thomas R.
