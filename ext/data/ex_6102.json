{"books":{"12":{"id":"6102","title":"Chemical Phenomena in Life","description":"Published in 1911 as part of the \"Harper's Library of Living Thought,\" this volume presents an introduction to the chemistry of cells in the context of plant physiology and gives an interesting overview of the field of biochemistry and related sciences at the time. The author, Frederick Czapek, was a Czech botanist and professor of Plant Physiology at the University of Prague. He is perhaps best known for his two-volume work on Plant Physiology, \"Biochemie der Pflanzen\" and for Czapek solution agar or Czapek-Dox medium, a culture medium for cultivation of fungus species such as <i>Aspergillus<\/i> and <i>Penicillium molds<\/i>.
