{"books":{"23":{"id":"9371","title":"Marion Fay","description":"Marion Fay (1882) by Anthony Trollope is a multi-threaded Victorian novel of social mores, romantic entanglements and occasional heartfelt pathos. Marion Fay is a Quaker's daughter courted by the idealistic Lord Hampstead. Meanwhile, his best friend, the impoverished George Roden, is in love with the Lord's noble sister. Differences of class and situation create romantic drama in typical Trollope fashion. <to be revised before completion> - Summary by Bookrenter.com","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30100","language":"English","copyright_year":"1882","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9371","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"513","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Trollope","dob":"1815","dod":"1882"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"324735","section_number":"1","title":"THE MARQUIS OF KINGSBURY.","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/marionfay_01_trollope_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8098","display_name":"Arnold"}]},{"id":"324736","section_number":"2","title":"LORD HAMPSTEAD.","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/marionfay_02_trollope_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8098","display_name":"Arnold"}]},{"id":"324737","section_number":"3","title":"THE MARCHIONESS.","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/marionfay_03_trollope_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8098","display_name":"Arnold"}]},{"id":"324738","section_number":"4","title":"LADY FRANCES.","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/marionfay_04_trollope_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8098","display_name":"Arnold"}]},{"id":"324739","section_number":"5","title":"MRS.
