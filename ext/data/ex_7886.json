We'd forgotten all about you,\" said Mrs. Quack. \"What was that you said?\" Jerry good-naturedly repeated what he had said. Mrs. Quack's face brightened. \"Do you really mean it?\" she asked eagerly. \"Do you really mean that you know of a pond where we could live and not be likely to be seen by these two-legged creatures called men?\" \"That's what I said,\" replied Jerry briefly. \"Oh, Jerry, you're not joking, are you? Tell me you're not joking,\" begged Mrs. Quack. \"Of course I'm not joking,\" returned Jerry just a little bit indignantly, \"I am not the kind of a fellow to joke people who are in such trouble as you and Mr. Quack seem to be in.\" (Summary by Burgess) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5846","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7886","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/poormrsquack_1307_librivox\/poormrsquack_1307_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-adventures-of-poor-mrs-quack-by-thornton-w-burgess\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:49:46","totaltimesecs":6586,"authors":[{"id":"282","first_name":"Thornton W.","last_name":"Burgess","dob":"1874","dod":"1965"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/poormrsquack_1307_librivox","sections":[{"id":"284561","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
