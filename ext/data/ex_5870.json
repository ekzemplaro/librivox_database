{"books":{"14":{"id":"5870","title":"Sturdy Oak","description":"At a certain committee meeting held in the spring of 1916, it was agreed that fourteen leading American authors, known to be extremely generous as well as gifted, should be asked to write a composite novel.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThird, to have the novel finished and published serially during the autumn Campaign of 1917.\r\n\r\nThe carrying out of these requirements has not been the childish diversion it may have seemed. Splendid team work, however, has made success possible.\r\n\r\nEvery author represented, every worker on the team, has gratuitously contributed his or her services; and every dollar realized by the serial and book publication of \"The Sturdy Oak\" will be devoted to the Suffrage Cause. But the novel itself is first of all a very human story of American life today. It neither unduly nor unfairly emphasizes the question of equal suffrage, and it should appeal to all lovers of good fiction.
