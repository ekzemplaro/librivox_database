{"books":{"1":{"id":"8612","title":"Jesus Himself","description":"Is it possible to be familiar with Jesus, to know the Bible, to be involved in church life, and yet not really know Jesus at all well?  Andrew Murray, with his perceptive insights into the church of his day, and indeed of ours too, shows how this is all too often the condition of many believers.  In the two essays comprising this book, Murray shows how we can move to a new place in really knowing Jesus, and how the presence of the Lord can become much more real to us.  There is a cost, but God always abundantly rewards those who seek Him with their whole heart. - Summary by Christopher Smith","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/jesushimself00murrgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"2","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8612","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/jesus_himself_1402_librivox\/jesus_himself_1402_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/jesus-himself-by-andrew-murray\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:54:39","totaltimesecs":3279,"authors":[{"id":"2839","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Murray","dob":"1828","dod":"1917"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/jesus_himself_1402_librivox","sections":[{"id":"303934","section_number":"1","title":"i.
