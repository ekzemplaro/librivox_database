{"books":{"15":{"id":"9785","title":"Deep In The Quiet Wood","description":"James Weldon Johnson was an American author, educator, lawyer, diplomat, songwriter, and civil rights activist. Johnson is best remembered for his leadership of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where he started working in 1917. In 1920 he was the first black to be chosen as executive secretary of the organization, effectively the operating officer.[1] He served in that position from 1920 to 1930. Johnson established his reputation as a writer, and was known during the Harlem Renaissance for his poems, novels, and anthologies collecting both poems and spirituals of black culture.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/17884","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9785","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox\/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/deep-in-the-quiet-wood-by-james-weldon-johnson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:21:30","totaltimesecs":1290,"authors":[{"id":"3012","first_name":"James Weldon","last_name":"Johnson","dob":"1871","dod":"1938"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"336735","section_number":"1","title":"Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/quietwood_johnson_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"80","file_name":"quietwood_johnson_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"336727","section_number":"2","title":"Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by AMH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/quietwood_johnson_amh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"71","file_name":"quietwood_johnson_amh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9920","display_name":"Annalyn"}]},{"id":"336732","section_number":"3","title":"Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/quietwood_johnson_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"88","file_name":"quietwood_johnson_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"336740","section_number":"4","title":"Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by CCS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/quietwood_johnson_ccs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"89","file_name":"quietwood_johnson_ccs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8337","display_name":"Claudia Salto"}]},{"id":"336737","section_number":"5","title":"Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/quietwood_johnson_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"75","file_name":"quietwood_johnson_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"336736","section_number":"6","title":"Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by ECB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/quietwood_johnson_ecb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"88","file_name":"quietwood_johnson_ecb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6408","display_name":"Elise C.
