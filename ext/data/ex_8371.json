{"books":{"6":{"id":"8371","title":"Little Match Girl","description":"This is a recording of seven immortal and delightful fairy tales written by Hans Christian Andersen.  The Little Match Girl is of course the first, followed by The Swineherd, The Real Princess, The Leap Frog, The Elderbush, The Bell and finally, The Old House.  They cover a wide range of topics but all demonstrate the storytelling genius of the prolific Danish author who gave us so many memorable and cherished tales.
