{"books":{"19":{"id":"9287","title":"Men, Women and Guns","description":"World War I reflections, as published in contemporary newspapers. This is a collection of McNeile's early short stories, drawing on his experiences with the Royal Engineers Corps. These are the memoirs which describe the experiences that made him who he was, and gave him his famous name \"Sapper\". This is WWI as told through the eyes of someone who was there, but leavened with humour and an eye for the ridiculous side of human nature. (I'll write a better summary after I've read the whole book! Beth Thomas) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/menwomenandguns01mcnegoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9287","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1858","first_name":"","last_name":"Sapper","dob":"1888","dod":"1937"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"322769","section_number":"0","title":"Prologue","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"322770","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1, Chapter 1 - The Motor Gun","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/menwomenandguns_01_mcneile_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6965","display_name":"NoelBadrian"}]},{"id":"322771","section_number":"2","title":"Part 1, Chapter 2 - Private Meyrick - Company Idiot","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322772","section_number":"3","title":"Part 1, Chapter 3 - Spud Trevor of the Red Hussars","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322773","section_number":"4","title":"Part 1, Chapter 4 - The Fatal Second","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322774","section_number":"5","title":"Part 1, Chapter 5 - Jim Brent's V.C","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322775","section_number":"6","title":"Part 1, Chapter 6 - Retribution","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322776","section_number":"7","title":"Part 1, Chapter 7 - The Death Grip","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322777","section_number":"8","title":"Part 1, Chapter 8 - James Henry","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322778","section_number":"9","title":"Part 2, Chapter 1 - The Grey House","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322779","section_number":"10","title":"Part 2, Chapter 2 - The Women and the Men","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322780","section_number":"11","title":"Part 2, Chapter 3 - The Women and the Man","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322781","section_number":"12","title":"Part 2, Chapter 4 - \"The Regiment\"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322782","section_number":"13","title":"Part 2, Chapter 5 - The Contrast","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322783","section_number":"14","title":"Part 2, Chapter 6 - Black, White and Grey","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322784","section_number":"15","title":"Part 2, Chapter 7 - Archie and Others","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322785","section_number":"16","title":"Part 2, Chapter 8 - On the Staff","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"322897","section_number":"17","title":"Part 2, Chapter 9 - No Answer","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"336773","section_number":"18","title":"Part 2, Chapter 10 - The Madness","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336774","section_number":"19","title":"Part 2, Chapter 11 - The Grey House Again","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"18","name":"Historical Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
