The aim has been to review the more significant events and tendencies in the recent political life of Canada. (from the Preface)<br \/>Sir Wilfrid Laurier (1841-1919) was a member of parliament for 45 years (1874-1919) and Prime Minister of Canada from 1896 to 1911. He was Canada's first French-speaking prime minister and did much to reconcile English and French Canada.
