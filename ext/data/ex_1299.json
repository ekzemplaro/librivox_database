{"books":{"31":{"id":"1299","title":"Extermination of the American Bison","description":"The American bison (Bison bison), also commonly known as the American buffalo, is a North American species of bison that once roamed the grasslands of North America in massive herds, became nearly extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle.  William T. Hornaday\u2019s advocacy is credited with preserving the American bison from extinction.  This book, originally published in 1887, gives Mr. Hornaday's evidence of the Bison's impending extinction.
