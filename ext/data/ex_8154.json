{"books":{"12":{"id":"8154","title":"Mrs. Bindle","description":"Herbert Jenkins' most popular fictional creation was Mr. Joseph Bindle, who first appeared in a humorous novel in 1916 and in a number of sequels. In the preface to the books, T. P. O'Connor said that \"Bindle is the greatest Cockney that has come into being through the medium of literature since Dickens wrote Pickwick Papers\". The stories are based on the comedic drama of life at work, at home and all the adventures that take place along the way. It becomes clear as the stories progress that Bindle would not be who he is without Mrs. Bindle, and this book seeks to tell the stories of the Bindles from the distaff point of view.
