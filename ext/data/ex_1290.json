{"books":{"1":{"id":"1290","title":"Shropshire Lad","description":"<p>A Shropshire Lad is a cycle of sixty-three poems by the English poet Alfred Edward Housman. A Shropshire Lad was first published in 1896 at Housman's own expense after several publishers had turned it down. At first the book sold slowly, but during the Second Boer War, Housman's nostalgic depiction of rural life and young men's early deaths struck a chord with English readers and the book became a bestseller. Later, World War I further increased its popularity.(Summary from Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/5720","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"2","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1290","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/shropshire_lad_a_librivox\/shropshire_lad_a_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Shropshire_Lad","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-shropshire-lad-by-ae-housman\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:53:25","totaltimesecs":3205,"authors":[{"id":"1173","first_name":"A.
