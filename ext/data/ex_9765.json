{"books":{"10":{"id":"9765","title":"Take it From Dad","description":"Take It From Dad is a collection of letters written by a father to his son, Ted, at boarding school, away from home for the first time. In each letter \"Dad\" comments on some aspect of Ted's experience, attitude, or behavior, illustrating and driving home his point with an entertaining tale about human nature. This book is appropriate for all ages from adolescence on, and its lessons are as relevant today as when they were written.\n--Lee Smalley","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/48596","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9765","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/take_it_from_dad_ls_1505_librivox\/take_it_from_dad_ls_1505_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/take-it-from-dad-by-george-livermore\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:19:21","totaltimesecs":11961,"authors":[{"id":"11279","first_name":"George","last_name":"Livermore","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/take_it_from_dad_ls_1505_librivox","sections":[{"id":"336282","section_number":"1","title":"September 25 - October 15","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_01_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1560","file_name":"takeitfromdad_01_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"336283","section_number":"2","title":"October 21 - October 26","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_02_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1043","file_name":"takeitfromdad_02_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"336284","section_number":"3","title":"October 30 - November 6","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_03_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"958","file_name":"takeitfromdad_03_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"336285","section_number":"4","title":"November 20 - December 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_04_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"944","file_name":"takeitfromdad_04_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"336286","section_number":"5","title":"December 10 - January 27","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_05_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"908","file_name":"takeitfromdad_05_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"336450","section_number":"6","title":"February 10 - February 20","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_06_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1224","file_name":"takeitfromdad_06_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"339619","section_number":"7","title":"February 28 - March 12","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_07_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"948","file_name":"takeitfromdad_07_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"340483","section_number":"8","title":"March 20 - March 28","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_08_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1070","file_name":"takeitfromdad_08_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"340484","section_number":"9","title":"April 6 - April 30","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_09_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"987","file_name":"takeitfromdad_09_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"340485","section_number":"10","title":"May 10 - May 26","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_10_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1210","file_name":"takeitfromdad_10_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"340486","section_number":"11","title":"June 8 - June 16","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/takeitfromdad_11_livermore_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1109","file_name":"takeitfromdad_11_livermore_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
