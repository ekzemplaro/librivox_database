{"books":{"75":{"id":"8887","title":"Sea Voyage","description":"Albert, a handsome French pirate, and his crew get shipwrecked on a barren, rocky island after a severe storm. They encounter another pair of castaways who reveal a quite unusual secret- another strange group of people inhabit the island. Albert soon learns that these people are actually an Amazon-ian like tribe of women, and propose an alliance for the benefit of both parties. Love and hijinks ensue in a battle of the sexes. - Summary by Mary
