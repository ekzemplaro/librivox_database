{"books":{"29":{"id":"9919","title":"Iolanthe","description":"A comic operetta by W. S. Gilbert, Iolanthe is a fairy banished from fairyland for the crime of marrying a mortal. Her half-fairy, half-human son Strephon is a fairy down to the waist, but his legs are human. He loves Phyllis, but she is courted by the whole House of Lords and the Lord High Chancellor himself! Strephon decides the only way to win his love is to go into Parliament, with the help of his mother and all his fairy aunts. None of them understand politics, but that doesn't matter. He will soon make some changes, starting with throwing the Peerage open to competitive examination! But how will Phyllis react when she catches Strephon with an impossibly young and very beautiful lady who he claims is his fairy mother? - Summary by Beth Thomas","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/808","language":"English","copyright_year":"1882","num_sections":"30","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9919","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iolanthe","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"334","first_name":"W.
