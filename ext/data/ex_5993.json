{"books":{"8":{"id":"5993","title":"Song Against Songs","description":"LibriVox volunteers bring you 9 recordings of The Song Against Songs by G. K. Chesterton. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for October 16, 2011.<br><br>Chesterton was a large man, standing 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and weighing around 21 stone (130 kg; 290 lb). His girth gave rise to a famous anecdote. During World War I a lady in London asked why he was not 'out at the Front'; he replied, 'If you go round to the side, you will see that I am.' On another occasion he remarked to his friend George Bernard Shaw: \"To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England\". Shaw retorted, \"To look at you, anyone would think you have caused it\". P. G. Wodehouse once described a very loud crash as \"a sound like Chesterton falling onto a sheet of tin.\"( Summary from Wikipedia )","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/35115","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5993","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/songagainstsong_1111_librivox\/songagainstsong_1111_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-song-against-songs-by-g-k-chesterton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:17:19","totaltimesecs":1039,"authors":[{"id":"426","first_name":"G.
