His famous diary, which covers a period of some ten years, throws a frank and intimate light on a fascinating period, through the lens of a vigorous, intelligent and refreshingly candid and extrovert personality. This volume covers the third year of the diary. - Summary by Nicole Lee","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4138","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10393","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/diary_of_samuel_pepys_1662_1512_librivox\/diary_of_samuel_pepys_1662_1512_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samuel_Pepys#The_diary","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-diary-of-samuel-pepys-1662-by-samuel-pepys\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"06:42:08","totaltimesecs":24128,"authors":[{"id":"2306","first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"Pepys","dob":"1633","dod":"1703"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/diary_of_samuel_pepys_1662_1512_librivox","sections":[{"id":"355842","section_number":"1","title":"January","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_01_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1630","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_01_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355843","section_number":"2","title":"February","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_02_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1284","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_02_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355844","section_number":"3","title":"March","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_03_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1305","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_03_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355845","section_number":"4","title":"April","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_04_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1335","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_04_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355846","section_number":"5","title":"May","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_05_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1700","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_05_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355847","section_number":"6","title":"June","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_06_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2228","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_06_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355848","section_number":"7","title":"July","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_07_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1894","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_07_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355849","section_number":"8","title":"August","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_08_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2438","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_08_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355850","section_number":"9","title":"September","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_09_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2322","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_09_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355851","section_number":"10","title":"October","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_10_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3009","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_10_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355852","section_number":"11","title":"November","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_11_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2255","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_11_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355853","section_number":"12","title":"December","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_12_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2728","file_name":"diaryofsamuelpepys1662_12_pepys_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"111","name":"Memoirs"}],"translators":[]}}}
