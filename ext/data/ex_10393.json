His famous diary, which covers a period of some ten years, throws a frank and intimate light on a fascinating period, through the lens of a vigorous, intelligent and refreshingly candid and extrovert personality. This volume covers the third year of the diary. - Summary by Nicole Lee","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4138","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10393","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samuel_Pepys#The_diary","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2306","first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"Pepys","dob":"1633","dod":"1703"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"355842","section_number":"1","title":"January","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_01_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355843","section_number":"2","title":"February","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_02_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355844","section_number":"3","title":"March","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_03_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355845","section_number":"4","title":"April","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_04_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355846","section_number":"5","title":"May","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_05_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355847","section_number":"6","title":"June","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_06_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355848","section_number":"7","title":"July","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_07_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355849","section_number":"8","title":"August","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_08_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355850","section_number":"9","title":"September","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_09_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355851","section_number":"10","title":"October","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_10_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355852","section_number":"11","title":"November","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/diaryofsamuelpepys1662_11_pepys.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]},{"id":"355853","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6660","display_name":"Nicole Lee"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"111","name":"Memoirs"}],"translators":[]}}}
