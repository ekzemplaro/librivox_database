The whole planet seemed to be slowly disappearing, the population dwindling month by month and year by year and yet no one seemd to care or even notice.  Something was very, very wrong. When the first interstellar transport in 30 years arrived on Halsey's Planet, it brought things to a head.  The ship had touched on six other colony worlds - and all six had been devoid of human life.   Where was everybody? It was almost as if humankind, when separated by cosmic distances from Mother Earth, could not survive. He didn't know the answer but he knew it all smelled highly of decay.  Decay and Rot.    This highly praised novel by C.M.Kornbluth and Frederick Pohl was first published in 1954 was seen as a wonderful satire on various trends in the society of the 1950's.    - Summary by phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/52228","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10970","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/search_the_sky_1606_librivox\/search_the_sky_1606_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Search_the_Sky","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/search-the-sky-by-frederik-pohl\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"06:47:18","totaltimesecs":24438,"authors":[{"id":"1236","first_name":"C.
