His arrival there is not very lucky: The pupils are bound to test his perseverance and cheerily comments every one of his perceived missteps. In the teacher's room, he soon finds himself in the middle of an intrigue between the jovial \"Porcupine\" and the fat \"Hubbard Squash\" on one side, and the effeminate \"Red Shirt\" and his follower \"Clown\" on the other. Will Botchan choose the right side in the end?\n\nBotchan - with morality as the main theme - is one of the most popular novels in Japan. S\u014dseki Natsume bases the story on his own experiences as teacher in Matsuyama, his first assignment away from Tokyo.
