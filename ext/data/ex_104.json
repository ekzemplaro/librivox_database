{"books":{"21":{"id":"104","title":"Merry Adventures of Robin Hood","description":"Robin Hood is the archetypal English folk hero; a courteous, pious and swashbuckling outlaw of the medi\u00e6val era who, in modern versions of the legend, is famous for robbing the rich to feed the poor and fighting against injustice and tyranny. He operates with his \"seven score\" (140 strong) group of fellow outlawed yeomen \u2013 named the Merry Men. He and his band are usually associated with Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire.<br><br>The Victorian era generated its own distinct versions of Robin Hood. The traditional tales were often adapted for children, most notably in Howard Pyle's Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. These versions firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor.(Summary from Wikipedia)<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/964","language":"English","copyright_year":"1883","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/104","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/merry_adventures_robin_hood_librivox\/merry_adventures_robin_hood_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Merry_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-merry-adventures-of-robin-hood-by-howard-pyle\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"11:00:49","totaltimesecs":39649,"authors":[{"id":"303","first_name":"Howard","last_name":"Pyle","dob":"1853","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/merry_adventures_robin_hood_librivox","sections":[{"id":"122248","section_number":"1","title":"How Robin Hood Came to be an Outlaw","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1655","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"66","display_name":"Alex Foster"}]},{"id":"122249","section_number":"2","title":"Robin Hood and the Tinker","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1727","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"122250","section_number":"3","title":"The Shooting Match at Nottingham Town","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1914","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne (1950 - 2014)"}]},{"id":"122251","section_number":"4","title":"Will Stutely Rescued by His Companions","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1553","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"200","display_name":"Maureen S.
