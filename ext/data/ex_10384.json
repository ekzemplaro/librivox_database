Her father is a clergyman, Mr. Walton, who's history has already been told in \"A Quiet Neighborhood\" Wynnie has a happy childhood and falls in love with a struggling artist. It is about Wynnie and her family, her little circle of old and new friends also play a part. We learn much about the poor of society of that time. This book is strongly set in the real, every-day world and our narrator is not serous when she calls her life ''quiet and ordinary''. Though there are some exciting incidents, visits, and long conversations about God.\n - Summary by
