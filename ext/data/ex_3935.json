{"books":{"61":{"id":"3935","title":"Ethics","description":"<P>The Ethics is a philosophical book written by Baruch Spinoza. It was written in Latin. Although it was published posthumously in 1677, it is his most famous work, and is considered his magnum opus.<BR>In The Ethics, Spinoza attempts to demonstrate a \"fully cohesive philosophical system that strives to provide a coherent picture of reality and to comprehend the meaning of an ethical life. Following a logical step-by-step format, it defines in turn the nature of God, the mind, human bondage to the emotions, and the power of understanding -- moving from a consideration of the eternal, to speculate upon humanity's place in the natural order, freedom, and the path to attainable happiness.\"(Wikipedia)<\/P>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/3800","language":"English","copyright_year":"1883","num_sections":"62","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3935","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ethics_1010_librivox\/ethics_1010_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ethics_(book)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-ethics-by-spinoza-benedict-de\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"11:54:28","totaltimesecs":42868,"authors":[{"id":"1355","first_name":"Benedict
