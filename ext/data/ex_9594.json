{"books":{"12":{"id":"9594","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood","description":"Francis Bret Harte was an American author and poet, best remembered for his short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and other romantic figures of the California Gold Rush. In a career spanning more than four decades, he wrote poetry, fiction, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials, and magazine sketches in addition to fiction. As he moved from California to the eastern U.S. to Europe, he incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been most often reprinted, adapted, and admired.  - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2507","language":"English","copyright_year":"1902","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9594","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox\/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/what-the-wolf-really-said-to-little-red-riding-hood-by-bret-harte\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:20:22","totaltimesecs":1222,"authors":[{"id":"40","first_name":"Bret","last_name":"Harte","dob":"1836","dod":"1902"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox","sections":[{"id":"330615","section_number":"1","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by CCS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_ccs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"104","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_ccs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8337","display_name":"Claudia Salto"}]},{"id":"330621","section_number":"2","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by DB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_db_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"101","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_db_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9515","display_name":"DomBombadil"}]},{"id":"330623","section_number":"3","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"85","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"330616","section_number":"4","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by EZWA","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_ezwa_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"99","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_ezwa_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"330625","section_number":"5","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by GB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_gb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"92","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_gb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"330624","section_number":"6","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"111","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"330619","section_number":"7","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by GLM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_glm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"73","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_glm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9732","display_name":"Gemma L Myers"}]},{"id":"330627","section_number":"8","title":"What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by JAB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/whatthewolf_harte_jab_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"87","file_name":"whatthewolf_harte_jab_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9825","display_name":"J.
