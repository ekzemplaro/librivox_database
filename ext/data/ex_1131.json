{"books":{"5":{"id":"1131","title":"Spurgeon's Sermons May 1858","description":"<p>Charles Spurgeon was a popular Baptist minister in London in mid-Victorian times; his ministry was highly influential and had a significant effect on many families in London and further afield. It was difficult to find a hall large enough to accommodate the crowd who wished to hear him. At times the Royal Surrey Gardens' Music Hall was hired to accomodate the Sunday congregation; this could seat 10,000 but large numbers were unable to gain admittance.<\/p>\n\n<p>His world-wide heritage is very much with us today through the many chuches built, missionary work begun, children's charity founded and theological colleges established as a result of his ministry.<\/p>\n\n<p>The sermons in this collection were preached buring May 1898 and published immediately at one penny (1d.) each. These were widely circulated and remain one of the all-time best-selling series of writings.
