{"books":{"23":{"id":"5282","title":"Flower Garden: A Handbook of Practical Garden Lore","description":"This book is a good reference on the perennial flower gardening and landscaping. It contains information on growing the plants from seed and explains how to grow and care for the traditional garden flowering plants, bulbs, trees, and shrubs. There are sections covering all aspects of ornamental gardens including water gardens and caring for house plants in the winter. The author has lots of unexpected but good advice in her chapter of Don\u2019ts, for example: \u201c Don\u2019t supply with cut flowers, plants and the like, people who spend more money for unnecessary luxuries than you do for your whole garden, and then tell you how foolish you are to spend so much time and money, and work so hard for your flowers.\u201d As this shows, the author is at times as colorful as the flowers in this informative book (Summary by A.L.
