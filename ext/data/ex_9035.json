{"books":{"7":{"id":"9035","title":"Autobiography of a Clown","description":"This \"as told to\" autobiography of Jules Turnour is based on a popular article that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post in 1909. Turnour relates through Marcosson his personal history and that of the circus, both in Europe and the United States. By recounting touching, amusing, and heartbreaking events that he experienced or witnessed, he demonstrates his love of circus life and his craft. \"As soon as I hear the music of the band...and the indescribable movement of the crowd toward the big tent...I am stirred to action, the weariness falls away like magic, and I am young again.\" Photographs of Mr. Turnour are interspersed throughout the text, which is accessible at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/46139  ~ Lee Smalley","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/46139","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9035","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/autobiography_clown_ls_1407_librivox\/autobiography_clown_ls_1407_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-autobiography-of-a-clown-by-isaac-marcosson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:28:43","totaltimesecs":5323,"authors":[{"id":"10718","first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"Marcosson","dob":"1877","dod":"1961"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/autobiography_clown_ls_1407_librivox","sections":[{"id":"316279","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_00_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"248","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_00_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"316278","section_number":"1","title":"I Am Born in a Circus Wagon","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_01_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"899","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_01_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"316271","section_number":"2","title":"I Become a Clown","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_02_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"777","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_02_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"316272","section_number":"3","title":"I Join the Tented Circus","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_03_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"667","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_03_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"316273","section_number":"4","title":"I Tell About Clown Tricks","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_04_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"950","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_04_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"316274","section_number":"5","title":"I Learn About Life","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_05_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"699","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_05_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"316275","section_number":"6","title":"I Relate Some Clown History","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_06_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"552","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_06_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"316276","section_number":"7","title":"I Give My Creed","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/autobiographyofaclown_07_marcosson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"531","file_name":"autobiographyofaclown_07_marcosson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
