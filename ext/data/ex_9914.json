{"books":{"10":{"id":"9914","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee.","description":"Sidney Clopton Lanier was an American musician, poet and author. He served in the Confederate army, worked on a blockade running ship for which he was imprisoned (resulting in his catching tuberculosis), taught, worked at a hotel where he gave musical performances, was a church organist, and worked as a lawyer. As a poet he used dialects. He became a flautist and sold poems to publications. He eventually became a university professor and is known for his adaptation of musical meter to poetry. Many schools, other structures and two lakes are named for him.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/579","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9914","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox\/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-song-of-the-chattahoochee-by-sidney-lanier\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:30:55","totaltimesecs":1855,"authors":[{"id":"3020","first_name":"Sidney","last_name":"Lanier","dob":"1842","dod":"1881"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"340985","section_number":"1","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"165","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"340988","section_number":"2","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by CB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_cb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"133","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_cb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9862","display_name":"Caitlin Buckley"}]},{"id":"340993","section_number":"3","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by CCS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_ccs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"210","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_ccs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8337","display_name":"Claudia Salto"}]},{"id":"340989","section_number":"4","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by CLP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_clp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"140","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_clp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9642","display_name":"Chris Pyle"}]},{"id":"340990","section_number":"5","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by DCC","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_dcc_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"176","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_dcc_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10038","display_name":"Domenica Campbell"}]},{"id":"340987","section_number":"6","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"183","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"340983","section_number":"7","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"135","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"340984","section_number":"8","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"189","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"340986","section_number":"9","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by LCW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_lcw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"161","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_lcw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"340991","section_number":"10","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"191","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"340992","section_number":"11","title":"The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by NB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/chattahoochee_lanier_nb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"172","file_name":"chattahoochee_lanier_nb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6965","display_name":"NoelBadrian"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
