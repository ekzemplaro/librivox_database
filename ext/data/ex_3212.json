{"books":{"20":{"id":"3212","title":"Promised Land","description":"Being a Jew in Russia at the end of the 19th century was not easy at all. Jews were persecuted because of their religion. So the Jews found comfort in their ancient traditions. When Mary Antin's father decided that keeping to his traditions did not suit him anymore, he found no place in Russia. So he emigrated to America with his family. Life was not easy, though as a child, Mary describes life in Boston as almost perfect. A smart and dignified girl, Mary takes the good things in anything and writes her autobiography with a smile.\nWhen you listen to Bridget reading this wonderful book, you can almost feel Mary Antin's trials and joys.\n(Summary by Stav Nisser)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/20885","language":"English","copyright_year":"1912","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3212","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/promised_land_bg_librivox\/promised_land_bg_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-promised-land-by-mary-antin\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:13:56","totaltimesecs":36836,"authors":[{"id":"4704","first_name":"
