{"books":{"2":{"id":"9320","title":"Second Letter of Paul to the Corinthians","description":"This second letter from the Apostle Paul to the congregation of believers in the bustling port city of Corinth gives us a much more personal understanding of Paul's apostleship.  He defends it rigorously, convincing his followers of his authority from God and his rights under that authority.  His appeals to patience and understanding display a great emotional vulnerability in the seasoned preacher and missionary.  He discusses the need to support the congregation in Jerusalem with their gifts, and reaffirms and vindicates his position as apostle to the Gentiles. - Summary by Mark Penfold","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8835","language":"English","copyright_year":"1903","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9320","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Second_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4721","first_name":"","last_name":"Weymouth New Testament","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"323556","section_number":"1","title":"2 Corinthians 1-5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2149","display_name":"Mark Penfold"}]},{"id":"323557","section_number":"2","title":"2 Corinthians 6-9","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2149","display_name":"Mark Penfold"}]},{"id":"323558","section_number":"3","title":"2 Corinthians 10-13","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2149","display_name":"Mark Penfold"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"79","name":"Bibles"}],"translators":[{"id":"1255","first_name":"Richard Frances","last_name":"Weymouth","dob":"1822","dod":"1902"}]}}}
