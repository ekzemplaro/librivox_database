{"books":{"5":{"id":"3645","title":"Royal Children of English History","description":"<p>From the first chapter: \"History is a story, a story of things that happened to real live people in our England years ago; and the things that are happening here and now, and that are put in the newspapers, will be history for little children one of these days. And the people you read about in history were real live people, who were good and bad, and glad and sorry, just as people are now-a-days.\"<br \/><br \/>E. Nesbit writes about some of the people behind the names, dates and battles of English History in this lovely book for older children.
