{"books":{"24":{"id":"9058","title":"Coast of Bohemia","description":"William Dean Howells is at his iconoclastic best in this exploration of bourgeois values, particularly in the clash between respectable society and the dubious bohemian world of Art and Poetry.  Cornelia Saunders has everything going for her in her middle-class world:  comfort, good looks, attentive young men.  She seems willing to risk it all for the sake of what might be an artistic Gift, venturing with great trepidation to put her foot over the line into Bohemia to see if it might be the thing for her.  Skewering the conventions of sentimental literature as usual, Howells keeps the reader guessing to the end as to the fate of Cornelia and her Gift. - Summary by
