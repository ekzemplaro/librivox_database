{"books":{"8":{"id":"3880","title":"The First Book of Adam and Eve","description":"<p><i>The Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan<\/i> is a Christian pseudepigraphical work found in Ge'ez, translated from an Arabic original and thought to date from the 5th or 6th century AD.  It was first translated from the Ethiopic version into German by August Dillmann. It was first translated into English by S. C. Malan from the German of Ernest Trumpp. The first half of Malan's translation is included as the \"First Book of Adam and Eve\" and the \"Second Book of Adam and Eve\" in The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden.  Books 1 and 2 begin immediately after the expulsion from the Garden of Eden and end with the testament and translation of Enoch. Great emphasis is placed in Book 1 on Adam's sorrow and helplessness in the world outside the garden.
