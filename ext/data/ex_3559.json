This book is old, but the basics haven't changed <i>too<\/i> much. All the French content is spoken by native French speakers.<br \/><br \/>The book includes sections on vocabulary, nouns, adjectives, verbs and phrases, and will still prove useful. Some of the phrases are dated but hilarious. If you need a flannel petticoat, or to chastise your washerwoman, this book is definitely for you!
