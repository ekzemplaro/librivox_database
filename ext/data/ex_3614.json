It is primarily based upon contemporary newspaper and pamphlet accounts of these trials. Where the criminal is particularly well known, such as the highwayman, burglar and escape artist Jack Sheppard, other sources were used as well. The readings used here are selected to illustrate different aspects of the eighteenth century criminal world and the British legal system.(Summary by Roy Shreiber)<p> ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/newcompletenewga01jackiala","language":"English","copyright_year":"1795","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3614","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/newgate_calendar1_0910_librivox\/newgate_calendar1_0910_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/extracts-from-the-new-and-complete-newgate-calendar-vol-1-by-william-jackson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:38:02","totaltimesecs":23882,"authors":[{"id":"5356","first_name":" William","last_name":"Jackson","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/newgate_calendar1_0910_librivox","sections":[{"id":"190212","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Michael & Catherine van Berghen and Gerard Dromelius, Rev.
