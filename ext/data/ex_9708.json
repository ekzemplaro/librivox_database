{"books":{"3":{"id":"9708","title":"Adventure","description":"This account of the strange and mysterious occurence, which came to be known as the Moberly-Jourdain Incident, was written by two English academics. While on holiday in France, the two ladies visited Versailles, and claimed to experience a \"time slip\" in which they stumbled upon Marie Antoinette and other 18th century people in the gardens around the Petit Trianon. They published \"An Adventure\" under pseudonyms, which are, as their publisher notes, \"the only fictitious words in the book.\" Although their account has, of course, been repeatedly disputed, no satisfactory explanation has been proposed for the incident. - Summary by Elizabeth Klett","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/adventurewithapp00mobe","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"4","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9708","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11261","first_name":"Eleanor","last_name":"Jourdain","dob":"1863","dod":"1924"},{"id":"11260","first_name":"Charlotte","last_name":"Moberly","dob":"1846","dod":"1937"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"334497","section_number":"1","title":"Preface\/Three Visits to the Petit Trianon","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"334498","section_number":"2","title":"Results of Research","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"334499","section_number":"3","title":"Answers to Questions","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"334500","section_number":"4","title":"A Reverie","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"}],"translators":[]}}}
