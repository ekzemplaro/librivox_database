{"books":{"79":{"id":"3440","title":"Prime Minister","description":"<p>The Prime Minister is the fifth in Trollope's series of six Palliser novels.  With Phineas' difficulties resolved, Trollope introduces new characters.  A respectable young girl forsakes the man her family had always intended her to marry when she falls in love with a man of foreign extraction and an unknown family.  He has a gentleman's education and manners, but his family background and financial means are mysterious.  Is he really a gentleman?  Meanwhile, Plantagenet Palliser becomes Prime Minister of a shaky coalition government, and Glencora and Madame Goessler are busy with the ensuing social obligations.
