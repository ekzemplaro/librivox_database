{"books":{"19":{"id":"7727","title":"Alcools","description":"Apollinaire is a pivotal figure in the history of French poetry. Friend of Picasso, albeit a sometimes volatile one, inventor of the term 'surrealism' and the poem without punctiation, he advocated a poetry that was direct and intuitive, free of any refined intellectualism. Alcools, published in 1913, represents his most significant collection of poems.
