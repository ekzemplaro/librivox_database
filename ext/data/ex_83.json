{"books":{"20":{"id":"83","title":"Vindication of the Rights of Woman","description":"<p>Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in which she argued that women are not naturally inferior to men, but only appeared to be because they lacked education. She suggested that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagined a social order founded on reason. - Today, Wollstonecraft is considered a foundational thinker in feminist philosophy. Her early advocacy of women's equality and her attacks on conventional femininity and the degradation of women presaged the later emergence of the feminist political movement. Feminist scholars and activists have cited both her philosophical ideas and personal struggles as important influences in their work. <br><br>\n<em>This is one of the 12 Books That Changed the World by Melvyn Bragg.<\/em> (Summary from Wikipedia and Alex Foster)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/etext02\/vorow10.txt","language":"English","copyright_year":"1792","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/83","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/vindication_woman_librivox\/vindication_woman_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-vindication-of-the-rights-of-woman-by-mary-wollstonecraft\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"9:46:16","totaltimesecs":35176,"authors":[{"id":"1349","first_name":"Mary","last_name":"Wollstonecraft","dob":"1759","dod":"1797"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/vindication_woman_librivox","sections":[{"id":"121834","section_number":"0","title":"Brief Sketch of the life of Mary Wollstonecraft (incl. letter)","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"968","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"66","display_name":"Alex Foster"}]},{"id":"121835","section_number":"1","title":"Author's Introduction","listen_url":"http:\/\/www.alexfoster.me.uk\/librivox\/votrow\/vindication_01_wollstonecraft.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"700","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"89","display_name":"Kristen McQuillin"}]},{"id":"121836","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 1: The Rights and Involved Duties Of Mankind Considered","listen_url":"http:\/\/www.alexfoster.me.uk\/librivox\/votrow\/vindication_02_wollstonecraft.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1419","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"121837","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 2: The Prevailing Opinion Of a Sexual Character Discussed","listen_url":"http:\/\/www.alexfoster.me.uk\/librivox\/votrow\/vindication_03_wollstonecraft.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3172","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"121838","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 3: The Same Subject Continued","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2056","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"56","display_name":"Kirsten Ferreri"}]},{"id":"121839","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 4: Observations On the State Of Degradation To Which Woman Is Reduced By Various Causes Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1656","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"655","display_name":"Margaine"}]},{"id":"121840","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 4: Observations On the State Of Degradation To Which Woman Is Reduced By Various Causes Part 2","listen_url":"http:\/\/www.alexfoster.me.uk\/librivox\/votrow\/vindication_06_wollstonecraft.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1644","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"26","display_name":"Denny Sayers"}]},{"id":"121841","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 4: Observations On the State Of Degradation To Which Woman Is Reduced By Various Causes Part 3","listen_url":"http:\/\/www.alexfoster.me.uk\/librivox\/votrow\/vindication_07_wollstonecraft.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1576","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":null,"display_name":null},{"reader_id":"688","display_name":"J.
