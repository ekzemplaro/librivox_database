{"books":{"94":{"id":"8195","title":"Mis\u00e9rables","description":"Les Mis\u00e9rables is a French historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. Upton Sinclair described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the English-speaking world.\" The novel is usually referred to by its original French title, which has not been successfully translated from French (attempts ranging from The Miserable, The Wretched, The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched Poor and The Victims, to The Dispossessed).\n\nBeginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, focusing on the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption. Examining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love. Les Mis\u00e9rables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for the stage, television, and film, including a musical and a film adaptation of that musical.
