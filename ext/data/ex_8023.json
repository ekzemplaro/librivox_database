This was the Weekly Poetry project for July 7, 2013.<br><br>Jean de La Fontaine was the most famous French fabulist and one of the most widely read French poets of the 17th century. He is known above all for his Fables, which provided a model for subsequent fabulists across Europe and numerous alternative versions in France, and in French regional languages.<br>According to Flaubert, he was the only French poet to understand and master the texture of the French language before Hugo.
