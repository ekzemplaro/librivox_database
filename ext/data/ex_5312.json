{"books":{"5":{"id":"5312","title":"Wherein?","description":"These studies in the book of Malachi were delivered as addresses to the students at Mr. Moody\u2019s Bible School in Chicago, and then to my own congregation. They have also appeared in \u201cThe Record of Christian Work\u201d in the United States, and in \u201cOut and Out\u201d in England. They are now sent out in a more permanent form, after careful revision, with the prayer that they may be used of God in calling His own children into the place of power without which form is nothing.
