{"books":{"21":{"id":"5567","title":"Girl on the Boat","description":"Also published as \"Three Men and a Maid\". The maid of the title is red-haired, dog-loving Wilhelmina \"Billie\" Bennet, and the three men are Bream Mortimer, a long-time friend and admirer of Billie, Eustace Hignett, a lily-livered poet who is engaged to Billie at the opening of the tale, and Sam Marlowe, Eustace's dashing cousin, who falls for Billie at first sight. All four find themselves on an ocean liner headed for England together, along with a capable young woman called Jane Hubbard who is smitten with Eustace, and typically Wodehousian romantic shenanigans ensue.
