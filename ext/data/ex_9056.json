{"books":{"20":{"id":"9056","title":"Journal of a Disappointed Man","description":"The journal of British naturalist Bruce Frederick Cummings, spanning from his early childhood through to his early death from complications stemming from multiple sclerosis. The diary combines beautiful, lyrical passages concerning the natural world with more introspective ruminations reminiscent of Kafka. Although successful and scandalous upon their publication in 1919, interest in the diaries has faded along with public interest in naturalism and diary writing more generally. However, Cummings' work is very modern is its forthright confessional tone and contains some deeply moving pieces of writing not easily forgotten. - Summary by Adam Whybray","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/39585","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9056","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"https:\/\/forum.librivox.org\/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=52761","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"254","first_name":"W.
