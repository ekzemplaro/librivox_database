{"books":{"5":{"id":"10329","title":"World of Sound","description":"The World of Sound consists of six lectures delivered before a juvenile auditory at the Royal Institution, Christmas, 1919. The Royal Institution Christmas Lectures are a series of lectures on a single topic, which have been held at the Royal Institution in London each year since 1825, except several years during the Second World War. The lectures present scientific subjects to a general audience, including young people, in an informative and entertaining manner. Michael Faraday initiated the first Christmas Lecture series in 1825, at a time when organised education for young people was scarce.
