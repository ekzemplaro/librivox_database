{"books":{"15":{"id":"3249","title":"Faerie Queene Books 6 & 7","description":"<p>'The Sixth Book of the Faerie Queene contayning the Legende of S, Calidore or of Cvrtesie.' \nApart from Books 1-6, the only surviving section of the Faerie Queene is a short isolated fragment known as the Mutabilitie Cantos (traditionally numbered Book 7, cantos 6-8); this fragment is also included in the present recording. Although the Faerie Queene was never completed, it continues to be one of the most beautiful and important works of literature ever written. Spenser wrote it as a paean to the Virgin Queen Elizabeth, and to the golden age which she had brought to England. Sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh and commended by the foremost literary minds of his day, Spenser's book remains one of the crowning poetic achievements of the Elizabethan period.(Summary by Annise)\n<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.uoregon.edu\/~rbear\/fqintro.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1590","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3249","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/faeriequeene6_0907_librivox\/faeriequeene6_0907_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-faerie-queene-books-7-and-8-by-edmund-spenser\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:32:04","totaltimesecs":19924,"authors":[{"id":"544","first_name":"Edmund","last_name":"Spenser","dob":"1552","dod":"1599"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/faeriequeene6_0907_librivox","sections":[{"id":"182627","section_number":"1","title":"bk6_00 - The Legende of Calidore - Prologue\t","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"204","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182628","section_number":"2","title":"bk6_01 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1316","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182629","section_number":"3","title":"bk6_02 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1358","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182630","section_number":"4","title":"bk6_03 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1384","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182631","section_number":"5","title":"bk6_04 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 04","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1125","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182632","section_number":"6","title":"bk6_05 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 05","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1152","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182633","section_number":"7","title":"bk6_06 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1258","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182634","section_number":"8","title":"bk6_07 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 07","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1359","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182635","section_number":"9","title":"bk6_08 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1638","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"182636","section_number":"10","title":"bk6_09 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1305","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182637","section_number":"11","title":"bk6_10 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1207","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182638","section_number":"12","title":"bk6_11 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1456","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182639","section_number":"13","title":"bk6_12 - The Legende of Calidore - Canto 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1165","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]},{"id":"182640","section_number":"14","title":"bk7_06 - The Cantos of Mutabilitie - Canto 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1631","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"182641","section_number":"15","title":"bk7_07 - The Cantos of Mutabilitie - Canto 7","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1835","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"182642","section_number":"16","title":"bk7_08 - The Cantos of Mutabilitie - Canto 8, unperfite","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3006","display_name":"MorganScorpion"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"11","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"},{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
