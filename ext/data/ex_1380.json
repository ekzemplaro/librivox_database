Paul is traditionally said to have written the letter while he was in prison in Rome (around 63 A.D.). This would be about the same time as the Epistle to the Colossians (which in many points it resembles) and the Epistle to Philemon.<\/p> <br>(Summary from Wikipedia)<\/br>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/ebible.org\/asv\/Eph.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1380","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/the_epistle_of_paul_the_apostle_to_the_ephesians_asv_ss_librivox\/the_epistle_of_paul_the_apostle_to_the_ephesians_asv_ss_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-epistle-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-ephesians-asv-ss\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:21:23","totaltimesecs":1283,"authors":[{"id":"187","first_name":"","last_name":"American Standard Version","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/the_epistle_of_paul_the_apostle_to_the_ephesians_asv_ss_librivox","sections":[{"id":"143980","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"209","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"143981","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"194","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"143982","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"180","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"143983","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"259","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"143984","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"235","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"143985","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"206","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"79","name":"Bibles"}],"translators":[]}}}
