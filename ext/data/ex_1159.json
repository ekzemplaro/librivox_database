{"books":{"8":{"id":"1159","title":"Ballad of the White Horse","description":"An English epic poem that follows the exploits of Alfred the Great in his defense of Christian civilization in England from the heathen nihilism of the North. Following a string of defeats at the hands of the invading Danes, a vision from heaven in the river island of Athelney fills Alfred with joy and hope. Though it gives no promise of victory in the coming struggle, it inspires him to rally his chieftains for a last stand against the invading hordes. His adventures lead throughout the country as he gathers his men, and take him through the Danish camps disguised as a minstrel before culminating in the Battle of Ethandune and the prophesying of the enemy's subtle return in the ages to come.

Christensen) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1719","language":"English","copyright_year":"1911","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1159","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ballad_of_the_whitehorse_jbc_librivox\/ballad_of_the_whitehorse_jbc_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Ballad_of_the_White_Horse","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-ballad-of-the-white-horse-by-gk-chesterton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:54:57","totaltimesecs":6897,"authors":[{"id":"426","first_name":"G.
