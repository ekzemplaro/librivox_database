{"books":{"12":{"id":"3288","title":"Triplanetary","description":"<p>\u201cDoc\u201d E.E. Smith pretty much invented the space opera genre, and Triplanetary is a good and well-known example. Physics, time, and politics never stand in the way of a plot that gallops ahead without letup.\r\nHaving earned a PhD in chemical engineering, it\u2019s understandable that the heroes of Smith\u2019s story are all scientists. He didn\u2019t want to be constrained by the limits of known science, however, so in his hands the electromagnetic spectrum becomes a raw material to be molded into ever-more amazing and lethal forms, and the speed of light is no bar to traveling through the interstellar void.\r\nCome enjoy this story of yesteryear, set in tomorrow, where real women ignite love at a glance, real men achieve in days what governments manage in decades, and aliens are an ever-present threat to Life-As-We-Know-It!

Smith)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/20782","language":"English","copyright_year":"1934","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3288","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/triplanetary_0907_librivox\/triplanetary_0907_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/triplanetary-by-ee-doc-smith\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:25:19","totaltimesecs":23119,"authors":[{"id":"2262","first_name":"E.
