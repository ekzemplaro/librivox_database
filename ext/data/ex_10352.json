{"books":{"38":{"id":"10352","title":"Old Crow and His Friends","description":"As opposed to the author's 'Myths and Legends' series, this volume has children's stories BASED on Indian stories which have been written originally in English instead of translated. Where a culture purist might prefer the direct translations of Indian myths for the fact that they come directly from Native American's themselves, the layman may well prefer these stories as they are paraphrased and\/or written anew, making them somewhat more coherent to an English speaker. - Summary by Kyle Van
