{"books":{"30":{"id":"926","title":"Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder","description":"<p>\"A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder\" is the most popular of James De Mille's works. It was serialized posthumously in Harper's Weekly, and published in book form by Harper and Brothers of New York City in 1888. This satiric romance is the story of Adam More, a British sailor. Shipwrecked in Antarctica, he stumbles upon a tropical lost world of prehistoric animals, plants, and a cult of death-worshipping primitives. He also finds a highly developed human society which has reversed the values of Victorian society. Wealth is scorned and poverty revered; death and darkness are preferrable to life and light. Rather than accumulating wealth, the natives seek to divest themselves of it as quickly as possible. At the beginning of each year, the government imposes wealth (the burden of \"reverse taxation\") upon its unfortunate subjects as a form of punishment. A secondary plot about the four yachtsmen who find the manuscript forms a frame for the central narrative. \n[Condensed from http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Strange_Manuscript_Found_in_a_Copper_Cylinder ]<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/6709","language":"English","copyright_year":"1888","num_sections":"31","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/926","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/strangemanuscript_0807_librivox\/strangemanuscript_0807_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Strange_Manuscript_Found_in_a_Copper_Cylinder","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-strange-manuscript-found-in-a-copper-cylinder-by-james-de-mille\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"9:16:05","totaltimesecs":33365,"authors":[{"id":"4349","first_name":" James","last_name":"De Mille","dob":"1833","dod":"1880"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/strangemanuscript_0807_librivox","sections":[{"id":"135216","section_number":"1","title":"The Finding of the Copper Cylinder","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"939","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1165","display_name":"Bob Graff"}]},{"id":"135217","section_number":"2","title":"Adrift in the Antarctic Ocean","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1022","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1165","display_name":"Bob Graff"}]},{"id":"135218","section_number":"3","title":"A World of Fire and Desolation","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1051","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1165","display_name":"Bob Graff"}]},{"id":"135219","section_number":"4","title":"The Sight of Human Beings","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1363","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1165","display_name":"Bob Graff"}]},{"id":"135220","section_number":"5","title":"The Torrent Sweeping Under the Mountains","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"982","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1165","display_name":"Bob Graff"}]},{"id":"135221","section_number":"6","title":"The New World","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1414","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1018","display_name":"JimmyLogan"}]},{"id":"135222","section_number":"7","title":"Scientific Theories and Scepticism","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1486","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2541","display_name":"Eddie Winter"}]},{"id":"135223","section_number":"8","title":"The Cave-Dwellers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1038","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2541","display_name":"Eddie Winter"}]},{"id":"135224","section_number":"9","title":"The Cavern of the Dead","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1058","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2541","display_name":"Eddie Winter"}]},{"id":"135225","section_number":"10","title":"The Sacred Hunt","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"917","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2517","display_name":"Gayland Darnell"}]},{"id":"135226","section_number":"11","title":"The Swamp Monster","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1091","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2517","display_name":"Gayland Darnell"}]},{"id":"135227","section_number":"12","title":"The Baleful Sacrifice","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"812","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2517","display_name":"Gayland Darnell"}]},{"id":"135228","section_number":"13","title":"The Awful \"Mista Kosek\"","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1004","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2517","display_name":"Gayland Darnell"}]},{"id":"135229","section_number":"14","title":"I Learn My Doom","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"893","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2517","display_name":"Gayland Darnell"}]},{"id":"135230","section_number":"15","title":"The Kohen is Inexorable","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1014","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2517","display_name":"Gayland Darnell"}]},{"id":"135231","section_number":"16","title":"The Kosekin","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1001","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2539","display_name":"Craig J.
