{"books":{"1":{"id":"1359","title":"Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven","description":"<p>\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\" is a short-story written by American writer Mark Twain and published in 1909. The story follows Captain Stormfield on his extremely long cosmic journey to heaven, his accidental misplacement, his short-lived interest in singing and playing the harp, and the obsession of souls with the \"celebrities\" of heaven, like Adam and Moses, whom, according to Twain, become as distant to most people in heaven as living celebrities are on Earth. Twain uses this story to show his view that the common conception of heaven is ludicrous and points out the incongruities of such beliefs.
