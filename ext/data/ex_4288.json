{"books":{"3":{"id":"4288","title":"Lays of Ancient Rome","description":"<p>\nThe Lays of Ancient Rome comprise four narrative poems comprised by Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay: recalling popular episodes from Roman historical-legends that were strongly moral in tone: exemplifying Roman virtue against Latine perfidy.\n\nThe four poems are:\n\n- Horatius - Horatius and two companions seek to hold back a large invading Etruscan force at the far end of a bridge over the Tiber River. The trio are willing to lay down their lives so as to prevent the Etruscans crossing and sacking the otherwise ill-defended Rome: it is a desperate gamble to buy enough time for the Romans to destroy the bridge in advance of the hostile army. But will their efforts succeed?\n\n- The Battle of Lake Regillus - The Romans take arms against the powerful Latine league headed by the expelled Tarquin nobles. The fighting is desperate and bloody: the event is decided only after the arrival upon the battlefield of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.\n\n- Virginia - Virginia is the daughter of Virginius - a poor, honest Roman farmer-citizen. In former years Virginius enlisted as a legionary and shed his blood to fight Rome's enemies: now Virginius - like other Romans of the humbler sort - suffer the usurious exactions of noblemen like the wicked Appius Claudius. Appius Claudius uses spurious legal means to take possession of Virginia as his \"runaway slave\": action guaranteed to succeed given the incumbent corrupt magistracy. So what can Virginius do? To what extremes is the father forced to protect his only child?\n\n- The Prophecy of Capys - Romulus and Remus return triumphant to the home of their grandfather Capys. When they arrive, Capys - blind and well advanced in years - is seized by a prophetic frenzy: Capys declaims a series of portents describing the future battles and victories destined as the lot of Romulus' descendants.\n\n(Introduction by Godsend)<p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/ofancientromlays00macarich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1842","num_sections":"4","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4288","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/lays_ancient_rome_1005_librivox\/lays_ancient_rome_1005_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lays_of_Ancient_Rome","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-lays-of-ancient-rome-by-thomas-babington-macaulay\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:28:55","totaltimesecs":5335,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/lays_ancient_rome_1005_librivox","sections":[{"id":"33939","section_number":"1","title":"Horatius","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1398","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"33940","section_number":"2","title":"The Battle of the Lake Regillus","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1862","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"33941","section_number":"3","title":"Virginia","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1336","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"33942","section_number":"4","title":"The Prophecy of Capys","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"739","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"69","name":"Narratives"}],"translators":[]}}}
