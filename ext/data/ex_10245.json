{"books":{"12":{"id":"10245","title":"New Alice in the Old Wonderland","description":"In this unofficial sequel to Alice in Wonderland, a different Alice, a young American girl named Alice Lee (a huge fan of the original book), stumbles upon a magical door that leads to Wonderland. There, she meets familiar faces, like the Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, Red Queen, among others, as well as some new ones. However, unlike our beloved English Alice who just tries to make sense of a senseless world, Alice Lee maintains power over her own fantasy, rather than let herself become the victim. Though a loving tribute to the original novels, Lewis Carroll absolutely disapproved of this novel, nearly seeking legal action against the British publication of it, but decided against it in favor of his reputation and privacy.  - Summary by Mary Kay and Carolin Sigler","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/anewaliceinoldw00richgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1895","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10245","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_New_Alice_in_the_Old_Wonderland","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11584","first_name":"Anna Matlack","last_name":"Richards","dob":"1835","dod":"1900"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"351207","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/newalice_00_richards_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351208","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I: Peggy the Pig","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/newalice_01_richards_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351209","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II: The Duchess and the House","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/newalice_02_richards_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351210","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III: The Tea-Table","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/newalice_03_richards_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351211","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV: Humpty Dumpty","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/newalice_04_richards_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351212","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter V: The White Knight","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/newalice_05_richards_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351213","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter VI: The Red Queen and the Duchess","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351214","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter VII: The Bishops","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351215","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter VIII: The Kindergarten","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351216","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter IX: The Mock Turtle","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351217","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter X: The Great Occasion","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351218","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XI: The Tweedles","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]},{"id":"351219","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter XII: The Pageant","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9392","display_name":"CJ Plog"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"39","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
