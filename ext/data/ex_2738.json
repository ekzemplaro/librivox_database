{"books":{"15":{"id":"2738","title":"Over the Top","description":"<p>Arthur Guy Empey was an American who responded to the sinking of the Lusitania by enlisting with the British Army to fight in France. His experiences in the trenches, including his ultimate wounding and convalescence, became this book. When published in 1917, it was a major hit and helped the recruiting effort when America entered the Great War.<br \/><br \/>If you've heard of the horror of trench warfare in WWI and want to see it from below dirt level, Empey offers it all here.<br \/><br \/>Also included is Empey's popular \"Tommy's Dictionary of the Trenches\" which humorously demistifies the slang used by the British soldier.

Smith)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/7962","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2738","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/overthetop_0812_librivox\/overthetop_0812_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/over-the-top-by-arthur-empey\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:04:16","totaltimesecs":25456,"authors":[{"id":"2600","first_name":"Arthur Guy","last_name":"Empey","dob":"1883","dod":"1963"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/overthetop_0812_librivox","sections":[{"id":"171773","section_number":"1","title":"Dedication, Foreword, and Glossary 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2832","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"204","display_name":"Mark F.
