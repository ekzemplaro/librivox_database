{"books":{"14":{"id":"10001","title":"Beauty Making","description":"Ella Wheeler was born in 1850 on a farm in Johnstown, Wisconsin, east of Janesville, the youngest of four children. The family soon moved north of Madison. She started writing poetry at a very early age, and was well known as a poet in her own state by the time she graduated from high school.\nHer best-known work was Poems of Passion. Her most enduring work was \"Solitude\", which contains the lines, \"Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone\". Her autobiography, The Worlds and I, was published in 1918, a year before her death.
