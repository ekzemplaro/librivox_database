This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for February 7th, 2010.\nF\u00e1timih Baragh\u00e1n\u00ed (1814\/1817 \u2013 1852), also known by the titles of T\u00e1hirih (Arabic for \u201cThe Pure One\u201d) and Qurratu\u2019l-\u2018Ayn (Arabic for \u201cConsolation of the Eyes\u201d) was an influential Iranian poet and B\u00e1b\u00ed heroine from the town of Qazv\u00edn. Her legacy is important to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, as well as supporters of women\u2019s rights in Iran. In 1844, she became the seventeenth disciple or \u201cLetter of the Living\u201d of the B\u00e1b (1819-1850). As the only woman in this initial group of disciples, she is often compared to Mary Magdalene. From June-July 1848, she attended the Conference of Badasht where she appeared without a veil in public (a shocking statement of women\u2019s rights) and declared that a new religious dispensation had been inaugurated. Coincidentally, shortly after this, the Seneca Falls Convention (an important women\u2019s rights convention) was held in New York on the 19th-20th of July, 1848. She was executed in Tehran in 1852. Before her death, she said that although she would be killed, they could not stop the emancipation of women. Edward Granville Browne described her thus: \u201cThe appearance of such a woman as Qurratu\u2019l-\u2018Ayn is in any country and any age a rare phenomenon, but in such a country as Persia it is a prodigy\u2014nay, almost a miracle. Alike in virtue of her marvellous beauty, her rare intellectual gifts, her fervid eloquence her fearless devotion, and her glorious martyrdom, she stands forth incomparable and immortal amidst her countrywomen.\u201d This poem is a ghazal composed in the K\u00e1mil metre. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. Browne notes that this poem appears to be addressed to the B\u00e1b. Browne made a versified translation of the poem, which first appeared in the J.R.A.S. in 1899.
