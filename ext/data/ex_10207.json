{"books":{"14":{"id":"10207","title":"In The Dark","description":"James Whitcomb Riley was an American writer, poet, and best-selling author. During his lifetime he was known as the \"Hoosier Poet\" and \"Children's Poet\" for his dialect works and his children's poetry respectively. His poems tended to be humorous or sentimental, and of the approximately one thousand poems that Riley authored, the majority are in dialect. \n\nRiley began his career writing verses as a sign maker and submitting poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. \n\nRiley became a bestselling author in the 1890s. His children's poems were compiled into a book and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy. Titled the Rhymes of Childhood, the book was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his own lifetime.  - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/691","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10207","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox\/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/in-the-dark-by-james-whitcomb-riley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:21:01","totaltimesecs":1261,"authors":[{"id":"1609","first_name":"James Whitcomb","last_name":"Riley","dob":"1849","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"349427","section_number":"1","title":"In The Dark - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":"inthedark_riley_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"349430","section_number":"2","title":"In The Dark - Read by CLP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_clp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"71","file_name":"inthedark_riley_clp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9642","display_name":"Chris Pyle"}]},{"id":"349420","section_number":"3","title":"In The Dark - Read by DEF","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_def_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"90","file_name":"inthedark_riley_def_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9698","display_name":"Doug Fajardo"}]},{"id":"349432","section_number":"4","title":"In The Dark - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"81","file_name":"inthedark_riley_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"349431","section_number":"5","title":"In The Dark - Read by EK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_ek_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"85","file_name":"inthedark_riley_ek_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10148","display_name":"Eva K."}]},{"id":"349424","section_number":"6","title":"In The Dark - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"82","file_name":"inthedark_riley_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"349421","section_number":"7","title":"In The Dark - Read by GB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_gb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"94","file_name":"inthedark_riley_gb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"349422","section_number":"8","title":"In The Dark - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inthedark_riley_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"79","file_name":"inthedark_riley_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
