{"books":{"19":{"id":"1562","title":"Shakespeare Monologues Collection vol. 05","description":"<\/p>LibriVox readers present the fifth collection of monologues from Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Containing 20 parts. <br><br>William Shakespeare (April 26, 1564 \u2013 April 23, 1616) remains widely to be considered the single greatest playwright of all time. He wrote in such a variety of genres - tragedy, comedy, romance, &c - that there is always at least one monologue in each of his plays. Some of these teach a lesson, some simply characterize Shakespeare at his best, some are funny, some sad, but all are very moving. Each monologue will touch everybody differently. Some people will be so moved by a particular monologue that they will want to record it.
