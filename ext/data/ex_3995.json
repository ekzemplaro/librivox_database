{"books":{"18":{"id":"3995","title":"East by West, Vol. 1","description":"<br \/><i>East by West: a Journey in the Recess<\/i> is an account of British journalist Henry Lucy's travels across America and on to the Far East during the parliamentary recess in 1883.<br \/><br \/> Lucy was one of the most influential journalists of his day and, as \"Toby M.P.\", a noted humorist in Punch magazine. His acute powers of observation and light touch make this a most engaging book. It is a fascinating insight into the Englishman's travels abroad within two decades of the American Civil War and the end of Japanese isolationism.<br \/><br \/>This is the first of two volumes covering his journey with his wife. This first volume includes his travels in America and in Japan, including the Atlantic and Pacific crossings by steamer. Volume II, which is also available <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/east-by-west-a-journey-in-the-recess-vol-ii-by-henry-w-lucy\/\">here<\/a> as an audio recording, continues his experiences in Japan and India, returning home via Aden and the Suez Canal.
