A Persian ruba'i is a two-line stanza with two parts (or hemistechs) per line, hence the word \"Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t\" (derived from the Arabic root word for \"four\"), meaning \"quatrains\". (Introduction by Wikipedia) <br><br>The three translations by women comprise this collection of recordings of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.
