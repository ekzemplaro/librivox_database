Scottish poet William McGonagall is widely considered to be one of the worst poets of the English language.  He wrote this poem in honor of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tay_Rail_Bridge\">The Tay Rail Bridge<\/a> which was opened in 1878 and which subsequently collapsed a year later, causing the death of 75 train passengers, and inspiring McGonagall to write yet famously bad poem entitled <em>The Tay Bridge Disaster<\/em>.
