{"books":{"29":{"id":"9534","title":"Chronicles of Clovis","description":"This is the third collection of short stories by Saki, following on from \u201cReginald\u201d and \u201cReginald in Russia\u201d. Although some of the stories have characters that do not appear elsewhere in the collection, many of them are loosely centred round the young Clovis Sangrail (effectively a reincarnation of Reginald).
