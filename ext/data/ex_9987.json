{"books":{"19":{"id":"9987","title":"Alarm Clocks","description":"Joyce Kilmer (born as Alfred Joyce Kilmer)  was an American writer and poet mainly remembered for a short poem titled \"Trees\" (1913), which was published in the collection Trees and Other Poems in 1914. While most of his works are largely unknown, a select few of his poems remain popular and are published frequently in anthologies.\nAt the time of his deployment to Europe during World War I, Kilmer was considered the leading American Roman Catholic poet and lecturer of his generation, whom critics often compared to British contemporaries G. K. Chesterton (1874\u20131936) and Hilaire Belloc (1870\u20131953). He enlisted in the New York National Guard and was deployed to France with the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famous \"Fighting 69th\") in 1917. He was killed by a sniper's bullet at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31.  - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/263","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9987","url_zip_file":"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox\/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/alarm-clocks-by-joyce-kilmer\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:23:07","totaltimesecs":1387,"authors":[{"id":"1341","first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"Kilmer","dob":"1886","dod":"1918"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"343237","section_number":"1","title":"Alarm Clocks -
