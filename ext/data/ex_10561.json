{"books":{"4":{"id":"10561","title":"Greybeards at Play","description":"G.K. Chesterton's first publication, \"Greybeards at Play\" is a collection of poetry and accompanying illustrations. The work is marked by the irreverent whimsy and ancient delight that would eventually be recognized as Chesterton's signature style. Short (only four poems long and a dedication), playful, and with a touch of awe, Chesterton's first piece (written at 26) is appropriately titled: it is the work of an amateur, mature in his spirit, young in his play. - (Summary by 5pak)","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/14706","language":"English","copyright_year":"1900","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10561","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/greybeardsatplay_1601_librivox\/greybeardsatplay_1601_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/greybeards-at-play-by-g-k-chesterton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:11:26","totaltimesecs":686,"authors":[{"id":"426","first_name":"G.
