The original text was published as an eight-page pamphlet. In the surviving copy, the bottoms of the pages have been cropped. A total of three lines are therefore missing, and a further three have been reconstructed from their surviving portions. The html version of the poem shows these reconstructions. This poem has been read using modern English pronunciation and spelling. Some words have no modern equivalent, including such words as encensing, entenderment, soote, boote, withouten, inuentions, contrarious, and minnish which is short for dimminish.<br>\nEmyspery = hemisphere.<br>\nQuayre (quire) = an eight-page printed booklet.<br>\nTene = harm, injury or hurt.<br>\nRother = rudder<br>\nThe \"monk of bery\" was John Lydgate of Bury St. Edmunds (c. 1370 - c.
