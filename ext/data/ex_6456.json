{"books":{"17":{"id":"6456","title":"Prayer: Its Necessity, Its Power, Its Conditions","description":"Redemptorist Father Ferreol Girardey's book, which bears an imprimatur, is a broad introductory treatise on the subject of prayer. He discusses the power and necessity of prayer, explains why some prayers do not seem to be answered, and tells us how to make our prayers more acceptable to God. In particular, he instructs the reader on what to pray for and for whom to pray. He also details the conditions necessary for efficacious prayer and explains the times when it is most suitable to pray. Father Girardey includes numerous lessons from the gospel on prayer and offers selections from Meditations for Every Day of the Year by Redemptorist Father Louis Bronchain.
