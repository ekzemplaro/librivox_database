{"books":{"21":{"id":"8215","title":"Tales of Wonder","description":"The Last Book of Wonder, originally published as Tales of Wonder, is the tenth book and sixth original short story collection of Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin and others.\n\nThe first edition, in hardcover, was published in London by Elkin Mathews in October 1916 as Tales of Wonder, followed by a Boston hardcover publication in November 1916, by John W. Luce & Co.. The title of the American edition, The Last Book of Wonder, was Dunsany's own preferred title. The British and American editions also differ in that they arrange the material slightly differently.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/13821","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8215","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"17","first_name":"Lord","last_name":"Dunsany","dob":"1878","dod":"1957"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"323026","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/talesofwonder_00_dunsany_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike
