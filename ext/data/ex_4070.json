{"books":{"8":{"id":"4070","title":"Proposed Roads to Freedom","description":"Bertrand Russell, 3rd Earl Russell (1872 \u2013 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, political activist and Nobel laureate. He led the British \"revolt against idealism\" in the early 1900s and is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ludwig Wittgenstein. In this book, written in 1918, he offers his assessment of three competing streams in the thought of the political left: Marxian socialism, anarchism and syndicalism.\n\n(Summary by Wikipedia\/Carl Manchester)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/690","language":"English","copyright_year":"1918","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4070","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/proposedroadstofreedom_1011_librivox\/proposedroadstofreedom_1011_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/proposed-roads-to-freedom-by-bertrand-russell\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:52:26","totaltimesecs":21146,"authors":[{"id":"1508","first_name":"Bertrand","last_name":"Russell","dob":"1872","dod":"1970"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/proposedroadstofreedom_1011_librivox","sections":[{"id":"28550","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"966","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4826","display_name":"Todd Garrison"}]},{"id":"28551","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Marx and Socialist Doctrine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2612","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"},{"reader_id":"4826","display_name":"Todd Garrison"}]},{"id":"28552","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Bakunin and Anarchism","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2308","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5038","display_name":"John Kooz"}]},{"id":"28553","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Syndicalist Revolt","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3069","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5038","display_name":"John Kooz"}]},{"id":"28554","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Work and Play","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2516","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5038","display_name":"John Kooz"}]},{"id":"28555","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Government and Law","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2689","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5130","display_name":"Thinking"}]},{"id":"28556","section_number":"6","title":"06 - International Relations","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2269","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5130","display_name":"Thinking"}]},{"id":"28557","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Science and Art Under Socialism","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1815","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5635","display_name":"Matthew Reece"}]},{"id":"28558","section_number":"8","title":"08 - The World as it Could be Made","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2902","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5720","display_name":"Thelma Meyer"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"},{"id":"99","name":"Political Science"}],"translators":[]}}}
