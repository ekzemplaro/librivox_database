{"books":{"8":{"id":"6605","title":"Legends of Genesis","description":"<i>The Legends of Genesis<\/i> is the English translation of the introduction to Gunkel\u2019s massive commentary, <i>Genesis<\/i>. Gunkel uses form critical analysis on the text of Genesis to determine the various genres of the biblical legends and their significance to the authors. Gunkel also uses form criticism to uncover buried clues as to the constituent sources of the text. Gunkel offers his hypothesis to explain how the various sources came to be combined and redacted, and how the text later came to be attributed to Moses.
