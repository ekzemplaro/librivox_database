{"books":{"5":{"id":"2131","title":"Old Mother West Wind","description":"<p>Thornton Waldo Burgess (January 14, 1874 \u2013 June 5, 1965) was a conservationist and author of children's stories. He loved the beauty of nature and its living creatures so much that he wrote about them for 50 years. By the time he retired, he had written more than 170 books.  Many of his outdoor observations in nature were used as plots for his stories. In his first book, \"Old Mother West Wind,\" published in 1910, the reader meets many of the characters found in later books and stories. These characters include Peter Rabbit, Jimmy Skunk, Sammy Jay, Bobby Raccoon, Joe Otter, Grandfather Frog, Billy Mink, Jerry Muskrat, Spotty the Turtle and of course, Old Mother West Wind and her Merry Little Breezes.  Note to parents of very small children: in Chapter 15, little Tommy Trout gets eaten by a pickerel.
