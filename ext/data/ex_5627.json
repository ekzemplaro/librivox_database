{"books":{"21":{"id":"5627","title":"Autobiography of an Electron","description":"\"While many scientific men now understand our place in the universe, we electrons are anxious that every person should know the very important part which we play in the workaday world. It was for this reason that my fellow-electrons urged me to write my own biography. I am pleased to say that my relationship with the scribe who has put down my story in the following pages has been of the most friendly description. I have allowed him to place what he calls \"The Scribe's Note\" at the beginning of each chapter, but it will be understood clearly that these are merely convenient embellishments, and that I am responsible for the story of my own experiences.\" (Introduction adapted from the text)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/36456","language":"English","copyright_year":"1911","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5627","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/autobiographyofanelectron_1201_librivox\/autobiographyofanelectron_1201_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-autobiography-of-an-electron-by-charles-r-gibson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:31:18","totaltimesecs":9078,"authors":[{"id":"2694","first_name":"Charles R.","last_name":"Gibson","dob":"1870","dod":"1931"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/autobiographyofanelectron_1201_librivox","sections":[{"id":"69963","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
