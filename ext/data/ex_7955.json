{"books":{"23":{"id":"7955","title":"Journal from Japan","description":"Marie Stopes was a highly controversial scientist and activist of her era, campaigning for radical new views of love-based marriage, birth control, and women\u2019s rights. As a scientist, she was a renowned palaeobotanist, specializing in issues concerning coal; these scientific pursuits led her to spend several years in Japan, where she not only studied fossils but also pursued a notorious relationship with Japanese botanist Fujii Kenjiro. She established the first birth-control and family-planning clinic in England in 1921. Stopes continues to be an ambiguous figure in historical consideration, her family-planning philosophies verging throughout her life on less-savory views such as eugenics and race purification, though the terminology employed at the time makes it unclear whether she was merely advocating more careful, consciously-planned, and responsible parenthood. That she rejected the fascist views of eugenics is plain by her anti-Nazi passions in later life. These journal entries from Japan cover the period of August 6, 1907 through January 24, 1909, and show both her incisively scientific observational powers and a keen sense of the profound beauty of Japanese culture and sensibilities, the latter of which she saw to be under threat during that era of modernization and industrialization.
