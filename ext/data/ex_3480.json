{"books":{"14":{"id":"3480","title":"Wise Woman","description":"George MacDonald was an influential Scottish author, poet, and Christian minister. MacDonald\u2019s works (particularly his fairy tales and fantasy novels) claimed the admiration of such authors as J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and Madeleine L\u2019Engle.<BR><BR>\nThe Wise Woman fairy tale was one of MacDonald\u2019s more popular works. This delightful story describes how a woman of mysterious powers pays visits to two very different young girls: one a princess, the other a shepherd\u2019s daughter. Neither girl is left unchanged by the startling events that are unleashed as a result: and the reader is confronted by astonishing fairy-worlds in which the girls are forced to choose between good and evil.\n<BR><BR>The Wise Woman has been subsequently republished under various titles, including:<BR>\n- The Lost Princess, and<BR>\n- A Double Story.
