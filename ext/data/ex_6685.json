This was the Weekly Poetry project for May 20, 2012.<br><br>Paul Laurence Dunbar (June 27, 1872 \u2013 February 9, 1906) was an African American poet, novelist, and playwright of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Much of his popular work in his lifetime used a Negro dialect, which helped him become one of the first nationally-accepted African American writers. Much of his writing, however, does not use dialect; these more traditional poems have become of greater interest to scholars.(Summary by Wikipedia )","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/18338","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6685","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/pool_1205_librivox\/pool_1205_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-pool-by-paul-laurence-dunbar\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:19:09","totaltimesecs":1149,"authors":[{"id":"546","first_name":"Paul Laurence","last_name":"Dunbar","dob":"1872","dod":"1906"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/pool_1205_librivox","sections":[{"id":"97120","section_number":"1","title":"The Pool - Read by AKMY","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"56","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7413","display_name":"ashnight1214"}]},{"id":"97121","section_number":"2","title":"The Pool - Read by AS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"50","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7348","display_name":"acousticwave"}]},{"id":"97122","section_number":"3","title":"The Pool - Read by CC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"63","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6402","display_name":"Chiquito Crasto"}]},{"id":"97123","section_number":"4","title":"The Pool - Read by DVD","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"52","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7243","display_name":"Denise Blike"}]},{"id":"97124","section_number":"5","title":"The Pool - Read by Elli","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"48","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3885","display_name":"Elli"}]},{"id":"97125","section_number":"6","title":"The Pool - Read by FS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"64","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6735","display_name":"fshort"}]},{"id":"97126","section_number":"7","title":"The Pool - Read by GC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"53","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6733","display_name":"Snapdragon"}]},{"id":"97127","section_number":"8","title":"The Pool - Read by JCM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3470","display_name":"Jason Mills"}]},{"id":"97128","section_number":"9","title":"The Pool - Read by JL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"58","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7171","display_name":"April Gonzales"}]},{"id":"97129","section_number":"10","title":"The Pool - Read by JM2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"51","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4697","display_name":"Jannie Meisberger"}]},{"id":"97130","section_number":"11","title":"The Pool - Read by JN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"50","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5424","display_name":"Julia Niedermaier"}]},{"id":"97131","section_number":"12","title":"The Pool - Read by LAH","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"56","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"97132","section_number":"13","title":"The Pool - Read by LLW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"69","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"97133","section_number":"14","title":"The Pool - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"55","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"97134","section_number":"15","title":"The Pool - Read by MCD","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"62","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7398","display_name":"Marie Daum"}]},{"id":"97135","section_number":"16","title":"The Pool - Read by MJF","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7218","display_name":"MJ Franck"}]},{"id":"97136","section_number":"17","title":"The Pool - Read by REF","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"64","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2269","display_name":"Rhonda Federman"}]},{"id":"97137","section_number":"18","title":"The Pool - Read by RN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"85","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3465","display_name":"ravenotation"}]},{"id":"97138","section_number":"19","title":"The Pool - Read by SB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"42","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7414","display_name":"sensibleyouth"}]},{"id":"97139","section_number":"20","title":"The Pool - Read by UM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7044","display_name":"ekzemplaro"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"27","name":"Romance"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"96","name":"Nature"}],"translators":[]}}}
