{"books":{"37":{"id":"147","title":"Art and Heart","description":"This special poetry collection was assembled to celebrate the first anniversary of the creation of LibriVox. LibriVox volunteers bring you 38 different recordings of Art and Heart, by Ella Wheeler Wilcox. This poem, originally suggested by Betsie Bush, was chosen for this special collection due to a general concensus that the message of the poem corresponds with the spirit of LibriVox.\n\nThe poem asserts that, \u201cIt is not art, but heart, that wins the wide world over.\u201d And so it is with LibriVox: it is not only the books, the poetry, the literature that make LibriVox what it is; but it is also the people, the diversity of voices, and all of the different lives and experiences that affect the way a person reads a piece of text. The art is the foundation of LibriVox, but the many hearts behind it are the true essence and spirit of LibriVox.\n\nFor more information on the the first anniversary of LibriVox, and to hear a one hour special audio program featuring interviews, bloopers, and samplers, please visit the Anniversary homepage:
