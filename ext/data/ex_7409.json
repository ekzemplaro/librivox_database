{"books":{"9":{"id":"7409","title":"Mark Twain\u2019s Journal Writings, Volume 2","description":"This second collection of essays by Mark Twain is a good example of the diversity of subject matter about which he wrote. As with the essays in Volume 1, many first appeared alone, in magazines or newspapers, before being printed as chapters of his larger works, while others were taken from larger works and reprinted in collections of essays. On top of being prolific, Mark Twain was a very successful marketer of his works. Volume 2 contains the following works: 1.) \"A Curious Experience\" - 1892 2.) \"The Heart of a Humorist\" - 1900 3.) \u201cHow Tom Sawyer Got His Fence Whitewashed\u201d- 1876 4.) \"Jim Smiley's Frog\" - 1870 5.) \"Luck\" - 1891 6.) \u201cA Dog\u2019s Tale\u201d - 1904 7.) \"Lost in the Snow\" - 1888 8.) \"Mark Twain on Overspeeding\" - 1908 9.) \"A Medieval Romance\" 1907 (Summary by John Greenman)","url_text_source":"","language":"English","copyright_year":"1908","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7409","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/mark_twain_journal_2_1302_librivox\/mark_twain_journal_2_1302_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/mark-twains-journal-writings-volume-2-by-mark-twain\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:39:57","totaltimesecs":9597,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/mark_twain_journal_2_1302_librivox","sections":[{"id":"113865","section_number":"1","title":"A Curious Exprience - Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2208","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113866","section_number":"2","title":"A Curious Exprience - Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1856","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113867","section_number":"3","title":"The Heart of a Humorist","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"194","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113868","section_number":"4","title":"How Tom Sawyer Got His Fence Whitewashed, excerpt from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"358","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113869","section_number":"5","title":"Jim Smiley's Frog","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"384","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113870","section_number":"6","title":"Luck","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"679","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113871","section_number":"7","title":"A Dog's Tale","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1516","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113872","section_number":"8","title":"Lost in the Snow","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1226","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113873","section_number":"9","title":"Mark Twain on Overspeeding","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"184","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"113874","section_number":"10","title":"A Medieval Romance","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"992","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"},{"id":"29","name":"Satire"},{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"}],"translators":[]}}}
