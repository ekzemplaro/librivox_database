{"books":{"6":{"id":"10414","title":"Poor Richard's Almanack","description":"A brief biographical sketch of Franklin's life, followed by a collection of 670  aphorisms (apothegms - short, pithy, instructive sayings) and proverbs that were scattered throughout the pages of his Poor Richard's  Almanack over its 25 years of once-a-year publication (1732-1758).  Many of these sayings are familiar to all . . .  \"a penny saved is a penny earned\" . . . \"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\" . . .  But here they all are for you to read (or hear) at least once! Most were not invented by him, but are little gems of wisdom Franklin gleaned from all over the world throughout his life. (A star preceding a saying signifies that it expresses two distinct and different thoughts.)\n - Summary by Michele Fry, Soloist","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/poorrichardsalma00franrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"7","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10414","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poor_Richard's_Almanack","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"350","first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Franklin","dob":"1706","dod":"1790"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"356433","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction, and Aphorisms 1-99","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/poorrichardsalmanack_00_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"356434","section_number":"1","title":"Aphorisms 100-199","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/poorrichardsalmanack_01_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"356435","section_number":"2","title":"Aphorisms 200-299","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/poorrichardsalmanack_02_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"356436","section_number":"3","title":"Aphorisms 300-399","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/poorrichardsalmanack_03_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"356437","section_number":"4","title":"Aphorisms 400-499","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"356438","section_number":"5","title":"Aphorisms 500-599","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"356439","section_number":"6","title":"Aphorisms 600-670","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"6","name":"Culture & Heritage"}],"translators":[]}}}
