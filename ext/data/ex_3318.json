{"books":{"26":{"id":"3318","title":"Music Notation and Terminology","description":"Until relatively recently, music students at all levels of study\u2014from the conservatories to public schools\u2014had few resources available for the formal study of musical notation and terminology in the classroom. In fact, it was not until 1914, when Professor Karl Gehrkens at the Oberlin School of Music published this compilation of class notes and sources he collected over the years, that a uniform text became available for schools and universities everywhere. Since the publication of this monumental work, similar textbooks have emerged, but Dr. Gehrkens\u2019 contribution remains thoroughly worthwhile\u2014particularly since it provides not just the definitions of musical terms, but also the historical context of those terms. This inclusion enables students of music to better understand and remember those terms, and provides a platform from which Gehrkens argues for a uniform usage of musical terminology. Also included in the book are numerous musical excerpts, pictures, and actual analyses of musical examples.\n\nRecommended for the musically curious as well as the serious musical student.
