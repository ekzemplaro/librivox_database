{"books":{"24":{"id":"10637","title":"Broken Heart","description":"** The super exciting \"Please Give Me Your Voice\" summary! (will be replaced before cataloging) ** Next to Tis Pity She's a Whore, this is seen as Ford's most popular drama. It is also my favourite play of all time! All is not right in Sparta and, as this era of tragedy's go, the issue is MARRIAGE. In brief - Penthea wants to marry Orgilus, but her brother Ithocles get's involved and bans it, making both couples really sad. He then makes her marry Bassanes, who's an abusive brute, but more wealthy than Orgilus! Ithocles then realises what he's done wrong and tries to get  his friend Prophilus to marry Orgilus's sister Euphrania. Still following? Ithocles himself wants to marry the princess of Sparta, Calantha, who chooses him over her current betrothed, her cousin Nearchus. Everyone is sad (I'm avoiding spoilers) and get's revenge on eachother in a range of fun and gory ways, as only a tragedy can portray. As always, hearts get broken, a couple of murders. The usual here at Librivox!! So come on, give it a go.
