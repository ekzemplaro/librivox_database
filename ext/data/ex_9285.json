{"books":{"24":{"id":"9285","title":"Sun and Saddle Leather","description":"Cowboy Poetry began as a 19th Century Performance Art staged around a crackling campfire, referencing tall tales and personal stories, lost girlfriends, and love of the vast unboundaried West. It was best accompanied by a hot tin cup of boiled coffee, dunked biscuits, and beef jerky. The rhymed couplets were easy to remember, and once the day's drive was done, everybody had a few hours to listen to friends and wonder at the stars. Badger Clark gave voice and record to this unique American folk art, and built on it to express his own creative genius. He was declared the first Poet Laureate of South Dakota, or as he liked to say, \u201cPoet Lariat.\u201d   Summary by Ed
