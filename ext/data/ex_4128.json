{"books":{"56":{"id":"4128","title":"Pickwick Papers (Version 2)","description":"<p>A sportsman who doesn't hunt; a poet who doesn't write; a lover with no one to love; all three are devoted to their cheerful and benevolent leader, Mr. Pickwick. Join him and his friends, Winkle, Snodgrass, and Tupman, as they tour the country in search of adventures, knowledge, and stories. Along the way, they have their share of mishaps, and meet plenty of interesting characters, both the good and the not so good. (Mr. Pickwick's dedicated manservant, Sam Weller, is a scene-stealer sure to delight just about everybody.)\n\nYou may shed a few tears along the way, but usually of the pleasant sort. This is a mostly lighthearted and humorous tale, with a number of subplots woven in, in Dickens\u2019 incomparable style.<br><br>(Introduction by Debra Lynn)<p> ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/580","language":"English","copyright_year":"1837","num_sections":"57","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4128","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/pickwick_papers_1009_librivox\/pickwick_papers_1009_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charles_Dickens","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/pickwick-papers-the-version-2-by-charles-dickens\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"29:43:02","totaltimesecs":106982,"authors":[{"id":"91","first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Dickens","dob":"1812","dod":"1870"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/pickwick_papers_1009_librivox","sections":[{"id":"29955","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The Pickwickians","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"816","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29956","section_number":"2","title":"02 - The first Day's Journey, and the first Evening's Adventures; with their Consequences","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3817","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29957","section_number":"3","title":"03 - A new Acquaintance--The Stroller's Tale--A disagreeable Interruption, and an unpleasant Encounter","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1724","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29958","section_number":"4","title":"04 - A Field Day and Bivouac--More new Friends--An Invitation to the Country","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1672","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29959","section_number":"5","title":"05 - A short one--Showing, among other Matters, how Mr. Pickwick undertook to drive, and Mr. Winkle to ride, and how they both did it","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1327","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29960","section_number":"6","title":"06 - An old-fashioned Card-party--The Clergyman's verses--The Story of the Convict's Return","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2011","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29961","section_number":"7","title":"07 - How Mr. Winkle, instead of shooting at the Pigeon and killing the Crow, shot at the Crow and wounded the Pigeon; how the Dingley Dell Cricket Club played All-Muggleton, and how All-Muggleton dined at the Dingley Dell Expense; with other interesting and instructive Matters","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1938","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29962","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Strongly illustrative of the Position, that the Course of True Love is not a Railway","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1762","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29963","section_number":"9","title":"09 - A Discovery and a Chase","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1206","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1166","display_name":"Debra Lynn"}]},{"id":"29964","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Clearing up all Doubts (if any existed) of the Disinterestedness of Mr. A.
