{"books":{"42":{"id":"3374","title":"Royal Book of Oz (dramatic reading)","description":"<p> When the professor decides to outline the ancestry of the eminent people of Oz, Scarecrow feels left out. He doesn't have a family tree - unless you count the bean pole on which he had been placed when the farmer put him in the cornfield! So he decides to seek out his roots . . . which leads him, Dorothy, and the Cowardly Lion on adventures they never dreamed, meeting new friends (and foes) along the way.
