{"books":{"17":{"id":"7114","title":"Wings and the Child","description":"\"When this book first came to my mind it came as a history and theory of the building of Magic Cities on tables, with bricks and toys and little things such as a child may find and use. But as I kept the thought by me it grew and changed, as thoughts will do, until at last it took shape as an attempt to contribute something, however small and unworthy, to the science of building a magic city in the soul of a child, a city built of all things pure and fine and beautiful.\" -- E. Nesbit<br><br>\"This lovely book describes the practicalities of building cities (or forts, secret bases and fairytale palaces) out of household odds-and-ends. It also goes much further to speak of the importance of developing a child's imagination and other aspects of Education beyond simple instruction. Nesbit may not have realised how multicultural her own Britain was, let alone ours now, or that the wider world might be interested in this book, so please forgive some rather dated phrasing in places.\" -- Cori Samuel","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/38977","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7114","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/wings_and_child_1210_librivox\/wings_and_child_1210_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/wings-and-the-child-by-e-edith-nesbit\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:53:34","totaltimesecs":14014,"authors":[{"id":"24","first_name":"E.","last_name":"Nesbit","dob":"1858","dod":"1924"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/wings_and_child_1210_librivox","sections":[{"id":"107794","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Part 1, Chapter 1 - Of Understanding","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"657","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107795","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Part 1, Chapter 2 - New Ways","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"639","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107796","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Part 1, Chapter 3 - Playthings","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"523","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107797","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Part 1, Chapter 4 - Imagination","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"505","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107798","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Part 1, Chapter 5 - Of Taking Root","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"656","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107799","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Part 1, Chapter 6 - Beauty and Knowledge","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"983","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107800","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Part 1, Chapter 7 - Of Building and Other Matters","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"831","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107801","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Part 1, Chapter 8 - The Moral Code","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1175","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107802","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Part 1, Chapter 9 - Praise and Punishment","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"933","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107803","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Part 1, Chapter 10 - The One Thing Needful","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"742","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107804","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Part 2, Chapter 1 - Romance in Games","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"866","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107805","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Part 2, Chapter 2 - Building Cities","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"911","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107806","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Part 2, Chapter 3 - Bricks -- and Other Things","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"917","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107807","section_number":"14","title":"14 - Part 2, Chapter 4 - The Magic City","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"825","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107808","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Part 2, Chapter 5 - Materials","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"651","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107809","section_number":"16","title":"16 - Part 2, Chapter 6 - Collections","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"721","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107810","section_number":"17","title":"17 - Part 2, Chapter 7 - The Poor Child's City","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"844","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"107811","section_number":"18","title":"18 - Part 2, Chapter 8 - The End","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"635","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"83","name":"Education"}],"translators":[]}}}
