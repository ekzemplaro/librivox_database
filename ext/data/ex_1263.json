{"books":{"7":{"id":"1263","title":"Book of Lieh-Tzu","description":"Although Lieh Tzu's work has evidently passed through the hands of many editors and gathered numerous accretions, there remains a considerable nucleus which in all probability was committed to writing by Lieh Tzu's immediate disciples, and is therefore older than the genuine parts of Chuang Tzu. There are some obvious analogies between the two authors, and indeed a certain amount of matter common to both; but on the whole Lieh Tzu's book bears an unmistakable impress of its own. The geniality of its tone contrasts with the somewhat hard brilliancy of Chuang Tzu, and a certain kindly sympathy with the aged, the poor and the humble of this life, not excluding the brute creation, makes itself felt throughout. - From Lionel Giles Introduction<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.sacred-texts.com\/tao\/tt\/index.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1912","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1263","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/lieh_tzu_cm_librivox\/lieh_tzu_cm_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liezi","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-book-of-lieh-tzu-by-lieh-tzu-translated-by-lionel-giles\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:56:22","totaltimesecs":10582,"authors":[{"id":"6236","first_name":"","last_name":"Liezi","dob":"","dod":"ca. 400 BC"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/lieh_tzu_cm_librivox","sections":[{"id":"141998","section_number":"0","title":"Editorial & Intro","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"881","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]},{"id":"141999","section_number":"1","title":"Cosmogony","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1882","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]},{"id":"142000","section_number":"2","title":"The Yellow Emperor","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2136","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]},{"id":"142001","section_number":"3","title":"Dreams","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1306","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]},{"id":"142002","section_number":"4","title":"Confucius","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"734","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]},{"id":"142003","section_number":"5","title":"The Questions of T'ang","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1306","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]},{"id":"142004","section_number":"6","title":"Effort & Destiny","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"627","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]},{"id":"142005","section_number":"7","title":"Causality","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1710","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1392","display_name":"Chris Masterson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"123","name":"Ancient"}],"translators":[{"id":"6441","first_name":" Lionel","last_name":"Giles","dob":"1875","dod":"1958"}]}}}
