She was the daughter of a British Prime Minister and the wife of a Romanian aristocrat. Active as a writer between 1921 and 1940, she drew on her experience in British high society in her work. A final posthumous collection of her stories, poems and aphorisms was published under the title Haven in 1951, with a preface by Elizabeth Bowen.\n\nKatharine Angell, reviewing Balloons for The Nation in 1923 wrote, \"Elizabeth Bibesco uses for her sketches material from which Katharine Mansfield would have made short stories and Henry James, novels ... Elizabeth Bibesco has a genius for compression, the compression into a few phrases of all the details of a situation, into a few pages the hopes and failures of a lifetime.\" - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/15156","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10442","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11716","first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Bibesco","dob":"1897","dod":"1945"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"357177","section_number":"1","title":"Haven","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"357178","section_number":"2","title":"Two Paris Episodes: The Story of a Coat, Balloons.","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10494","display_name":"Jennifer Fournier"}]},{"id":"357179","section_number":"3","title":"Courtship","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10471","display_name":"Henry Santos"}]},{"id":"357180","section_number":"4","title":"\"Do you remember...?\"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357181","section_number":"5","title":"The Martyr","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10289","display_name":"Tony Addison"}]},{"id":"357182","section_number":"6","title":"A Motor","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357183","section_number":"7","title":"The Masterpiece","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357184","section_number":"8","title":"Tea Time","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10344","display_name":"Jacquelyn Bengfort"}]},{"id":"357185","section_number":"9","title":"The End","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10481","display_name":"JudyDerby"}]},{"id":"357186","section_number":"10","title":"Misunderstood","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357187","section_number":"11","title":"Counterpoint","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357188","section_number":"12","title":"Villegiatura","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357189","section_number":"13","title":"Auld Lang Syne","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357190","section_number":"14","title":"Two Taxi Drives: Sunshine, Lamps.","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357191","section_number":"15","title":"A Touch of Spring","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10481","display_name":"JudyDerby"}]},{"id":"357192","section_number":"16","title":"Fido and Ponto","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"6","name":"Culture & Heritage"},{"id":"76","name":"Single Author Collections"}],"translators":[]}}}
