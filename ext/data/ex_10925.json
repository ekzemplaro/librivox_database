Over a dozen volumes of poetry followed and he became well known for his light-hearted poems for children, among the most famous of which are \"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod\" and \"The Duel\" (which is perhaps better known as \"The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat\"). Equally famous is his poem about the death of a child, \"Little Boy Blue\". Field also published a number of short stories, including \"The Holy Cross\" and \"Daniel and the Devil.\" - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/9889","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10925","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"614","first_name":"Eugene","last_name":"Field","dob":"1850","dod":"1895"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"371853","section_number":"1","title":"Dr. Sam - Read by AV","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/drsam_field_av_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10913","display_name":"Amanda Veale"}]},{"id":"371847","section_number":"2","title":"Dr. Sam - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/drsam_field_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"371848","section_number":"3","title":"Dr. Sam - Read by MSD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/drsam_field_msd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10891","display_name":"Matthew Datcher"}]},{"id":"371849","section_number":"4","title":"Dr. Sam - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/drsam_field_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"371850","section_number":"5","title":"Dr. Sam - Read by CLP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/drsam_field_clp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9642","display_name":"Chris Pyle"}]},{"id":"371851","section_number":"6","title":"Dr. Sam - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/drsam_field_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"371852","section_number":"7","title":"Dr. Sam - Read by TP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/drsam_field_tp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10789","display_name":"Tomas Peter"}]},{"id":"371854","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371855","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371856","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371857","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371858","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371859","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371860","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371861","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371862","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371863","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371864","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371865","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371866","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
