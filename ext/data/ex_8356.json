{"books":{"7":{"id":"8356","title":"Paulownia: Seven Stories from Contemporary Japanese Writers","description":"Paulownia is a collection of seven stories by three Japanese authors from the late 19th and early 20th century. <br><br>\n\nMori \u014cgai was an army surgeon who was sent to study in Germany, where he developed an interest in Western literature. His most famous work is <em>The Wild Geese (Gan)<\/em>. This collection contains his short stories <em>Takase Bune<\/em>, <em>Hanako<\/em>, and <em>The Pier<\/em>. <br> \nNagai Kaf\u016b writings center mostly around the entertainment districts of Tokyo with their geisha and prostitutes. Here, his stories <em>The bill-collecting<\/em> and <em>Ukiyo-e<\/em> are presented.<br>\nShimazaki T\u014dson was one of the representatives of Japanese naturalism, which we can see in his stories <em>A Domestic Animal<\/em> and <em>Tsugaru Strait<\/em>. <br><br>\n\nTaketomo Torao, the editor and translator of this volume, translated many Western works into Japanese, for example the Rubayat, the Divine Comedy, and works by Shakespeare. He was also a writer in his own right.
