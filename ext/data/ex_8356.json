{"books":{"7":{"id":"8356","title":"Paulownia: Seven Stories from Contemporary Japanese Writers","description":"Paulownia is a collection of seven stories by three Japanese authors from the late 19th and early 20th century. <br><br>\n\n<b>Mori \u014cgai<\/b> was an army surgeon who was sent to study in Germany, where he developed an interest in Western literature. His most famous work is <em>The Wild Geese (Gan)<\/em>. This collection contains his short stories <em>Takase Bune<\/em>, <em>Hanako<\/em>, and <em>The Pier<\/em>. <br> <br> \n\n<b>Nagai Kaf\u016b's<\/b> writings center mostly around the entertainment districts of Tokyo with their geisha and prostitutes. Here, his stories <em>The bill-collecting<\/em> and <em>Ukiyo-e<\/em> are presented.<br><br> \n\n<b>Shimazaki T\u014dson<\/b> was one of the representatives of Japanese naturalism, which we can see in his stories <em>A Domestic Animal<\/em> and <em>Tsugaru Strait<\/em>. <br><br>\n\n<b>Taketomo Torao<\/b>, the editor and translator of this volume, translated many Western works into Japanese, for example the Rubayat, the Divine Comedy, and works by Shakespeare. He was also a writer in his own right. <br><br> ","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/paulowniasevenst00takeiala","language":"English","copyright_year":"1918","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8356","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/paulownia_1410_librivox\/paulownia_1410_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/paulownia-by-torao-taketomo","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:25:53","totaltimesecs":8753,"authors":[{"id":"3099","first_name":"\u014cgai","last_name":"Mori","dob":"1862","dod":"1922"},{"id":"10205","first_name":"Kaf\u016b","last_name":"Nagai","dob":"1879","dod":"1959"},{"id":"3545","first_name":"T\u014dson","last_name":"Shimazaki","dob":"1872","dod":"1943"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/paulownia_1410_librivox","sections":[{"id":"297929","section_number":"0","title":"Foreword and Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_0_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"803","file_name":"paulownia_0_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"297930","section_number":"1","title":"Takase bune by Mori \u014cgai","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_1_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1580","file_name":"paulownia_1_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"297931","section_number":"2","title":"Hanako by Mori \u014cgai","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_2_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"894","file_name":"paulownia_2_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"297932","section_number":"3","title":"The pier by Mori \u014cgai","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_3_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"736","file_name":"paulownia_3_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"297933","section_number":"4","title":"The bill-collecting by Nagai Kaf\u016b","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_4_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1643","file_name":"paulownia_4_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"297934","section_number":"5","title":"Ukiyoe by Nagai Kaf\u016b","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_5_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"568","file_name":"paulownia_5_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"297935","section_number":"6","title":"A domestic animal by Shimazaki T\u014dson","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_6_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"858","file_name":"paulownia_6_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"297936","section_number":"7","title":"Tsugaru Strait by Shimazaki T\u014dson","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/paulownia_7_taketomo_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1671","file_name":"paulownia_7_taketomo_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"}],"translators":[{"id":"10206","first_name":"Torao","last_name":"Taketomo","dob":"1891","dod":"1954"}]}}}
