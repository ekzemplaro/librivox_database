This was the Weekly Poetry project for January 9th, 2011.<br><br>William Morris  was an English textile designer, artist, writer, and socialist associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the English Arts and Crafts Movement. Morris wrote and published poetry, fiction, and translations of ancient and medieval texts throughout his life.<br><br>Today, Morris's poetry is little-read. His fantasy romances languished out of print for decades until their rediscovery amid the great fantasy revival of the late 1960s following the phenomenal success of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. But his textile and wallpaper designs remain a staple of the Arts and Crafts Revival of the turn of the 21st century, and the reproduction of Morris designs as fabric, wrapping paper, and craft kits of all sorts is testament to the enduring appeal of his work. The William Morris Societies in Britain, the US, and Canada are active in preserving Morris's work and ideas.<p> ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/3468]","language":"English","copyright_year":"1892","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5097","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox\/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/echoes-of-loves-house-by-william-morris\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:16:21","totaltimesecs":981,"authors":[{"id":"961","first_name":"William","last_name":"Morris","dob":"1834","dod":"1896"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox","sections":[{"id":"55513","section_number":"1","title":"Echoes of Love's House- Read by ALG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"76","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4744","display_name":"Amy Gramour"}]},{"id":"55514","section_number":"2","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by CC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"87","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4586","display_name":"Chris Caron"}]},{"id":"55515","section_number":"3","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"87","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"55516","section_number":"4","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by DRB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"55517","section_number":"5","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by EL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"80","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5994","display_name":"Elynn Liu"}]},{"id":"55518","section_number":"6","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by GHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"94","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"55519","section_number":"7","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by JB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"93","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"77","display_name":"JemmaBlythe"}]},{"id":"55520","section_number":"8","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by KW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"75","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5876","display_name":"kelleywyskiel"}]},{"id":"55521","section_number":"9","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by LAH","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"99","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"55522","section_number":"10","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by LLW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"100","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"55523","section_number":"11","title":"Echoes of Love's House - Read by MDK","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"94","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5991","display_name":"Marc Kockinos"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"27","name":"Romance"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"},{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"}],"translators":[]}}}
