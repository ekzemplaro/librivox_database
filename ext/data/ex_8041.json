{"books":{"15":{"id":"8041","title":"Bush Debate","description":"<p>In 1892, two of Australia's best poets came up with a scheme to make some money. They arranged to have an argument in the Weekly Bulletin, and since they were being paid by the word, this let them fire back and forth, being sent beer money with each salvo. A couple of other poets also joined in, and their work is seminal to the development of the Bush ethos in Australia.<br \/>\n\nThe first eight files are the original form of the poems, and the second eight are later republications by the authors, in their own collections.
