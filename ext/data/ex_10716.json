{"books":{"24":{"id":"10716","title":"Recalled to Life","description":"A woman is haunted by a terrible event she witnessed in her youth but is unable to make sense of -- a murder, the sight of which is so traumatic that it drives every memory of life up to that moment from her mind. The murdered man was her father, she learns later, She can recall the murder scene, the sight of her father dying in his library, and one other thing. She saw the murderer. But when she calls that scene to mind, the murderer's face is blank. Gradually, over a period of years, memories begin to return in fits and starts. But are the memories credible, and will they aid her in her quest to put a face to her father's murderer? - Summary by Jacquerie","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5832","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10716","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"285","first_name":"Grant","last_name":"Allen","dob":"1848","dod":"1899"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"364916","section_number":"0","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3967","display_name":"Christine Dufour"}]},{"id":"364918","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I, Una Callingham's First Recollection;
