{"books":{"8":{"id":"608","title":"Extraordinary Adventures of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, Gentleman-Burglar","description":"A contemporary of Arthur Conan Doyle, Maurice Leblanc (1864-1941) was the creator of the character of gentleman thief Ars\u00e8ne Lupin who, in France, has enjoyed a popularity as long-lasting and considerable as Sherlock Holmes in the English-speaking world. This is the delightful first of twenty volumes in the Ars\u00e8ne Lupin series written by Leblanc himself. In an unprecedented act of literary pastiche and cross-over, Sherlock Holmes and Lupin actually meet, briefly in this first volume, and more substantially in the next. But after legal objections from Conan Doyle, the name was changed to \"Herlock Sholmes.\" (adapted from Wikipedia by a.r.dobbs)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/6133","language":"English","copyright_year":"1907","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/608","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/extraordinary_lupin\/extraordinary_lupin_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ars\u00e8ne_Lupin","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-extraordinary-adventures-of-arsene-lupin-gentleman-burglar","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:54:47","totaltimesecs":21287,"authors":[{"id":"2350","first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"Leblanc","dob":"1864","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/extraordinary_lupin","sections":[{"id":"129812","section_number":"1","title":"The Arrest of Arsene Lupin","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1419","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"103","display_name":"Karen Savage"}]},{"id":"129813","section_number":"2","title":"Arsene Lupin in Prison","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2852","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"129814","section_number":"3","title":"The Escape of Arsene Lupin","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2724","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"167","display_name":"Peter Yearsley"}]},{"id":"129815","section_number":"4","title":"The Mysterious Traveller","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2143","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"129816","section_number":"5","title":"The Queen's Necklace","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2001","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"606","display_name":"Julian Jamison"}]},{"id":"129817","section_number":"6","title":"The Seven of Hearts","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3917","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"753","display_name":"Tim Bulkeley"}]},{"id":"129818","section_number":"7","title":"Madame Imbert's Safe","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1231","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"119","display_name":"Alex Patterson"}]},{"id":"129819","section_number":"8","title":"The Black Pearl ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1923","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"129820","section_number":"9","title":"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3077","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"753","display_name":"Tim Bulkeley"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"22","name":"Detective Fiction"}],"translators":[{"id":"221","first_name":"","last_name":"Unknown","dob":"","dod":""}]}}}
