{"books":{"40":{"id":"8016","title":"Underground Railroad, Part 4","description":"\"The work is intensely interesting. Many of the narratives thrill the reader through and through. Some of them awaken an indignation, a horror, or a sense of humiliation and shame that makes the blood curdle or the cheek flush, or the breathing difficult. The best and the worst sides of human nature are successfully exhibited. Here heroism and patience stand out transfigured; there selfishness and brutality hold carnival till it seems as though justice had been exiled and God had forgotten his own. The number of cases reported is very large, and the method in which the author has done his work is commendable. There is no rhetorical ambition. The narratives are embodied in plain language. The facts are left to make their own impression, without an attempt to embellish them by the aid of imagination.\" From the \"Morning Star,\" Dover, New Hampshire.\n<br><br>\nWilliam Still is often called the Father of the Underground Railroad. Over 14 years, he helped hundreds of slaves escape to freedom in Canada. Still was committed to preserving the stories of the bondmen and he kept careful records of the many escaped slaves who passed through the Philadelphia \u201cstation\u201d. The Underground Railroad was published in 1871 from Still\u2019s records and diaries. In bringing you these stories, Librivox volunteers are reading from the 1878 edition.
