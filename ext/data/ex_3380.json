{"books":{"14":{"id":"3380","title":"Surprising Adventures of the Magical Monarch of Mo and His People","description":"<p>The Magical Monarch of Mo is a set of stories about the titular king, his queen, and his royal children. The stories are uproariously funny, dealing with topics as absurd as a man losing his temper who then tries to find it, an evil midget who steals a princess's big toe, and an entire city filled with highly civilized monkeys! Join the Monarch and all his friends for a rollicking adventure, filled with fun for the whole family!(Summary by Miriam Esther Goldman)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/16259","language":"English","copyright_year":"1898","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3380","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/magical_monarch_mo_1003_librivox\/magical_monarch_mo_1003_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Magical_Monarch_of_Mo","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-surprising-adventures-of-the-magical-monarch-of-mo-and-his-people-by-l-frank-baum\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:00:58","totaltimesecs":10858,"authors":[{"id":"406","first_name":"L.
