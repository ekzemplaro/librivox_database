{"books":[{"id":"1522","title":"Eleven Theses on Feuerbach","description":"The \u201cTheses on Feuerbach\u201d are eleven short philosophical notes written by Karl Marx in 1845. They outline a critique of the ideas of Marx\u2019s fellow Young Hegelian philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach. The theses form a basis for the activism emphasised by Marx\u2019s work, and this short text is perhaps best know for its ending - a Eureka for revolutionary socialism. The theses were written in 1845, but not published until 1888 (five years after Marx\u2019s death), with slight modifications by Friedrich Engels. The original text was published in 1924. This translation is based on the 1888 version.
