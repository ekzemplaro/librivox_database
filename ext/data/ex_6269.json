{"books":{"20":{"id":"6269","title":"Historic Waterways","description":"Historic Waterways, Six Hundred Miles of Canoeing down the Rock, Fox and Wisconsin Rivers.<br>This volume is the record of six hundred miles of canoeing experiences on historic waterways in Wisconsin and Illinois during the summer of 1887. There has been no attempt at exaggeration, to color its homely incidents, or to picture charms where none exist. It is intended to be a simple, truthful narrative of what was seen and done upon a series of novel outings through the heart of the Northwest. If it may induce others to undertake similar excursions, and thus increase the little navy of healthy and self-satisfied canoeists, the object of the publication will have been attained.
