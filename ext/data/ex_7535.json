{"books":{"23":{"id":"7535","title":"Tale of Pony Twinkleheels","description":"\"When Johnnie Green sent him along the road at a trot, Twinkleheels' tiny feet moved so fast that you could scarcely have told one from another. Being a pony, and only half as big as a horse, he had to move his legs twice as quickly as a horse did in order to travel at a horse's speed. Twinkleheels' friends knew that he didn't care to be beaten by any horse, no matter how long-legged. \"It's spirit, not size, that counts,\" Farmer Green often remarked as he watched Twinkleheels tripping out of the yard, sometimes with Johnnie on his back, sometimes drawing Johnnie in a little, red-wheeled buggy. Old dog Spot agreed with Farmer Green. When Twinkleheels first came to live on the farm Spot had thought him something of a joke.\" (Summary by author) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/18656","language":"English","copyright_year":"1921","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7535","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/taleofponytwinkleheels_1303_librivox\/taleofponytwinkleheels_1303_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-tale-of-pony-twinkleheels-by-arthur-scott-bailey\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:36:14","totaltimesecs":5774,"authors":[{"id":"464","first_name":"Arthur Scott","last_name":"Bailey","dob":"1877","dod":"1949"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/taleofponytwinkleheels_1303_librivox","sections":[{"id":"116131","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
