{"books":{"43":{"id":"4207","title":"Atlantis: The Antediluvian World","description":"\"Atlantis: The Antediluvian World is a book published during 1882 by Minnesota populist politician Ignatius L. Donnelly, who was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during 1831. Donnelly considered Plato's account of Atlantis as largely factual and attempted to establish that all known ancient civilizations were descended from this supposed lost land. Many of its theories are the source of many modern-day concepts we have about Atlantis, like the civilization and technology beyond its time, the origins of all present races and civilizations, a civil war between good and evil, etc.\" (Summary by Wikipedia)\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/4032","language":"English","copyright_year":"1882","num_sections":"44","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4207","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/atlantis_antediluvian_world_1102_librivox\/atlantis_antediluvian_world_1102_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atlantis:_The_Antediluvian_World","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/atlantis-the-antediluvian-world-by-ignatius-loyola-donnelly\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"16:54:06","totaltimesecs":60846,"authors":[{"id":"1762","first_name":"Ignatius Loyola","last_name":"Donnelly","dob":"1831","dod":"1901"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/atlantis_antediluvian_world_1102_librivox","sections":[{"id":"32102","section_number":"1","title":"01 - [Part I.
