{"books":{"12":{"id":"426","title":"Invisible Man","description":"<i>The Invisible Man<\/i> (1897) is one of the most famous science fiction novels of all time. Written by H.G. Wells (1866-1946), it tells the story of a scientist who discovers the secret of invisibility and uses it on himself. The story begins as the Invisible Man, with a bandaged face and a heavy coat and gloves, takes a train to lodge in a country inn whilst he tries to discover the antidote and make himself visible again. The book inspired several films and is notable for its vivid descriptions of the invisible man--no mean feat, given that you can't see him!","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/5230","language":"English","copyright_year":"1897","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/426","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/invisible_man_librivox\/invisible_man_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Invisible_Man","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/invisible-man-by-h-g-wells\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:54:05","totaltimesecs":17645,"authors":[{"id":"146","first_name":"H.
