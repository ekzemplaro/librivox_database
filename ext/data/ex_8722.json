{"books":{"32":{"id":"8722","title":"Pepper and Salt","description":"One must have a little pinch of seasoning in this dull, heavy life of ours; one should never look to have all the troubles, the labors, and the cares, with never a whit of innocent jollity and mirth. Yes, one must smile now and then, if for nothing else than to lift the corners of the lips in laughter that are only too often dragged down in sorrow. \u2026 Yet listen! One must not look to have nothing but pepper and salt in this life of ours\u2014no, indeed! At that rate we would be worse off than we are now. I only mean that it is a good and pleasant thing to have something to lend the more solid part a little savor now and then! \u2026\nAre you ready? Very well; then I will tell you a story. - Summary by from the
