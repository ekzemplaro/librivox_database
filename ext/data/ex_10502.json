{"books":{"2":{"id":"10502","title":"Philoctetes (Campbell Translation)","description":"Philoctetes is a play by Sophocles (Aeschylus and Euripides also each wrote a Philoctetes but theirs have not survived). The play was written during the Peloponnesian War. It is one of the seven tragedies of Sophocles to have survived the ravages of time in its complete form. It was first performed at the Festival of Dionysus in 409 BC, where it won first prize. The story takes place during the Trojan War (after the majority of the events of the Iliad, and before the Trojan Horse). It describes the attempt by Neoptolemus and Odysseus to bring the disabled Philoctetes, the master archer, with them to Troy. - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/cu31924026676266","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10502","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/philoctetes_campbell_translation_1512_librivox\/philoctetes_campbell_translation_1512_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Philoctetes_(Sophocles_play)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/philoctetes-campbell-translation-by-sophocles\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:27:48","totaltimesecs":5268,"authors":[{"id":"1157","first_name":"","last_name":"Sophocles","dob":"497 BC","dod":"406 BC"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/philoctetes_campbell_translation_1512_librivox","sections":[{"id":"358903","section_number":"1","title":"Part I","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/philoctetes_01_sophocles_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1830","file_name":"philoctetes_01_sophocles_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8713","display_name":"Expatriate"}]},{"id":"358904","section_number":"2","title":"Part II","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/philoctetes_02_sophocles_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1784","file_name":"philoctetes_02_sophocles_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8713","display_name":"Expatriate"}]},{"id":"358905","section_number":"3","title":"Part III","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/philoctetes_03_sophocles_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1654","file_name":"philoctetes_03_sophocles_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8713","display_name":"Expatriate"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"61","name":"Tragedy"}],"translators":[{"id":"6907","first_name":" Lewis","last_name":"Campbell","dob":"1830","dod":"1908"}]}}}
