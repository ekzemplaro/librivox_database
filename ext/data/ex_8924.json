{"books":{"7":{"id":"8924","title":"Eclogae (Eclogues)","description":"Dante's short correspondence in verse with Giovanni del Vergilio was only published in 1719, but is believed to have been written at some point in the last years of the poet's life. What we have are two poems by Dante and the answers by Iohannes (Giovanni's Latin name), all in Latin hexameters, emulating the style of Vergil. Even though the works were named after Vergil's bucolic poetry, the poems also echo the Georgics and the Aeneid, and are truly a masterpiece by a master of poetry. In this audiobook, we present the four poems in the original Latin, each followed by its translation by H.E. Plumptre.  - Summary by Leni","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/divinacommediaca04dantiala","language":"Multilingual","copyright_year":"1899","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8924","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eclogues_(Dante)","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1189","first_name":"Dante","last_name":"Alighieri","dob":"1265","dod":"1321"},{"id":"10596","first_name":"Giovanni del","last_name":"Vergilio","dob":"late 13th ","dod":"c. 1327"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"312778","section_number":"1","title":"Ecloga Prima, by Giovanni del Vergilio","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/leni\/eclogae_01_alighieri_128kb.mp3","language":"Latin","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"312779","section_number":"2","title":"First Eclogue, by Giovanni del Vergilio","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/leni\/eclogae_02_alighieri_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"312780","section_number":"3","title":"Ecloga Secunda, by Dante Alighieri","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/leni\/eclogae_03_alighieri_128kb.mp3","language":"Latin","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"312781","section_number":"4","title":"Second Eclogue, by Dante Alighieri","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/leni\/eclogae_04_alighieri_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"312782","section_number":"5","title":"Ecloga Tertia, by Giovanni del Vergilio","listen_url":null,"language":"Latin","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"312783","section_number":"6","title":"Third Eclogue, by Giovanni del Vergilio","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/leni\/eclogae_06_alighieri_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"312784","section_number":"7","title":"Ecloga Quarta, by Dante Alighieri","listen_url":null,"language":"Latin","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"312785","section_number":"8","title":"Fourth Eclogue, by Dante Alighieri","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"8","name":"Epistolary Fiction"},{"id":"63","name":"Single author"}],"translators":[{"id":"10528","first_name":"Edward Hayes","last_name":"Plumptre","dob":"1821","dod":"1891"}]}}}
