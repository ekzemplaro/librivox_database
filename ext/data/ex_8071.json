He felt this was a crime that needed to be fixed and so he wrote this book explaining sex for young and old. Ignorance of basic reproductive processes he felt led to experimentation that then led to sin, crime and prostitution. While this book is definitely not written in what I would call Plain English, contains some very questionable 'facts' about masturbation and menstruation and might seem very moralistic and dogmatic to our current society, he does hold out high ideas for all in affairs of self respect, love and marriage. If nothing else, this is a delightful peek into the thoughts of almost all people our very recent country's past(Summary by the reader, Phil Chenevert )<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/23680","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8071","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_1309_librivox\/sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_1309_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/sex-avoided-subjects-discussed-in-plain-english-by-henry-stanton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:45:31","totaltimesecs":6331,"authors":[{"id":"4862","first_name":" Henry","last_name":"Stanton","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_1309_librivox","sections":[{"id":"290584","section_number":"1","title":"SEX","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_01_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"795","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_01_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290585","section_number":"2","title":"THE TRANSITION FROM CELL TO HUMAN BEING","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_02_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"860","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_02_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290586","section_number":"3","title":"SEX IN MALE CHILDHOOD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_03_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"614","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_03_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290587","section_number":"4","title":"SEX IN FEMALE CHILDHOOD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_04_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"439","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_04_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290588","section_number":"5","title":"SEX IN THE ADOLESCENT MALE (FROM PUBERTY TO MATURITY)","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_05_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"556","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_05_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290589","section_number":"6","title":"SEX IN THE ADOLESCENT FEMALE (FROM PUBERTY TO MATURITY)","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_06_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"844","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_06_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290590","section_number":"7","title":"SEX IN THE MARRIAGE RELATION THE HUSBAND","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_07_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"238","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_07_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290591","section_number":"8","title":"SEX IN THE MARRIAGE RELATION THE WIFE","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_08_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"882","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_08_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290592","section_number":"9","title":"SEX DISEASES","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_09_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"453","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_09_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"290593","section_number":"10","title":"LOVE AND SEX","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/sexdiscussedinplainenglish_10_stanton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"650","file_name":"sex_avoided_subjects_discussed_in_plain_english_10_stanton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"85","name":"Family & Relationships"}],"translators":[]}}}
