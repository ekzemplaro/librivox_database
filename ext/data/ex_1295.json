Val and Holly have returned from South Africa and Val is training racehorses in Sussex. June has opened her gallery near Cork Street.<p><\/p>Soames arranges to meet Fleur at June\u2019s gallery and while there, and again later in a patisserie, they see Irene and Jon. Soames ignores them but Fleur and Jon are attracted to one another at a distance.<p><\/p>\nAs they leave, Fleur drops her handkerchief...
