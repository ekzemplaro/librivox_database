{"books":{"19":{"id":"5506","title":"At The Sign of The Jack O'Lantern","description":"This begins with an odd inheritance at the end of a honeymoon, both parties being inexperienced. Then someone comes to visit, then another, until we've got a chaotic bedlam of New England's tragically off the wall odd-ball relations. Our protagonists may not communicate efficiently at first but at least they've got a sense of humour. The humourous style keeps up as well as some moments of lustre and rich feeling about the printed word itself. (Introduction by D. Wor)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/26673","language":"English","copyright_year":"1902","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5506","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/sign_jack_olantern_1202_librivox\/sign_jack_olantern_1202_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/at-the-sign-of-the-jack-olantern-by-myrtle-reed\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:09:31","totaltimesecs":25771,"authors":[{"id":"2406","first_name":"Myrtle","last_name":"Reed","dob":"1874","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/sign_jack_olantern_1202_librivox","sections":[{"id":"66761","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The end of the honeymoon","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1249","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66762","section_number":"2","title":"02 - The day afterward","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1220","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66763","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The First Caller","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1286","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66764","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Finances","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"962","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66765","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Mrs. Smithers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1135","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66766","section_number":"6","title":"06 - The Coming of Elaine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1194","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66767","section_number":"7","title":"07 - An Uninvited Guest","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1184","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66768","section_number":"8","title":"08 - More","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1196","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66769","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Another","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1273","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66770","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Still More","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1353","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66771","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Mrs. Dodd's Third Husband","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1295","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66772","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Her Gift To The World","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1345","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66773","section_number":"13","title":"13 - A Sensitive Soul","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1209","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66774","section_number":"14","title":"14 - Mrs. Dodd's Fifth Fate","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1342","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66775","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Treasure-Trove","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1610","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66776","section_number":"16","title":"16 - Good Fortune","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1292","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66777","section_number":"17","title":"17 - The Lady Elaine Knows Her Heart","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1393","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66778","section_number":"18","title":"18 - Uncle Ebeneezer's Diary","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1536","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66779","section_number":"19","title":"19 - Various Departures","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1384","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]},{"id":"66780","section_number":"20","title":"20 - The Love of Another Elaine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1313","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6415","display_name":"Daryl Wor"}]}],"genres":[],"translators":[]}}}
