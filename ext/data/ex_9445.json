{"books":{"1":{"id":"9445","title":"Abraham Lincoln's Inaugural Addresses","description":"Lincoln's first inaugural address was delivered on March 4th, 1861, as the North and South were sliding towards separation and Civil War. His second inaugural, given just weeks before his assassination, was also delivered on March 4th but four years later, in 1865. Just over a month later, April 18th, 1865, the Civil War ended with the surrender of the Confederate army. This was four days after Lincoln was shot on April 14th. He died the next day. - Summary by John Greenman<\/p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=0pybK980vUUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Abraham+Lincoln's+inaugural+addresses&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jyWKVM6dCJC1sQThxICgDg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abraham Lincoln's inaugural addresses&f=false","language":"English","copyright_year":"1907","num_sections":"2","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9445","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_1501_librivox\/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_1501_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/abraham-lincolns-inaugural-addresses-by-abraham-lincoln\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:42:04","totaltimesecs":2524,"authors":[{"id":"2233","first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"Lincoln","dob":"1809","dod":"1865"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_1501_librivox","sections":[{"id":"326762","section_number":"1","title":"Abraham Lincoln's First Inaugural Address","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/abrahamlincolnsinauguraladdresses_01_lincoln.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2095","file_name":"lincolnsinauguraladdresses_01_lincoln_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]},{"id":"326763","section_number":"2","title":"Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/abrahamlincolnsinauguraladdresses_02_lincoln.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"429","file_name":"lincolnsinauguraladdresses_02_lincoln_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"107","display_name":"John Greenman"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"99","name":"Political Science"},{"id":"116","name":"Modern (19th C)"}],"translators":[]}}}
