{"books":{"13":{"id":"10126","title":"Christ Legends","description":"These are beautiful little stories about Christmas from the Swedish storyteller Selma Lagerlof.  As she explains in the first story, they were told her by her grandmother \"I remember that grandmother told story after story from morning till night, and that we children sat beside her, quite still, and listened. It was a glorious life! No other children had such happy times as we did.   It isn\u2019t much that I recollect about my grandmother. I remember that she had very beautiful snow-white hair, and stooped when she walked, and that she always sat and knitted a stocking.   And I even remember that when she had finished a story, she used to lay her hand on my head and say: \u201cAll this is as true, as true as that I see you and you see me.\u201d   - Summary by Phil chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/44818","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10126","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"176","first_name":"Selma","last_name":"Lagerl\u00f6f","dob":"1858","dod":"1940"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"347189","section_number":"1","title":"THE HOLY NIGHT","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/christlegends_01_lagerlof_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"347190","section_number":"2","title":"THE EMPEROR\u2019S VISION","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/christlegends_02_lagerlof_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"347191","section_number":"3","title":"THE WISE MEN\u2019S WELL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347192","section_number":"4","title":"BETHLEHEM\u2019S CHILDREN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347193","section_number":"5","title":"THE FLIGHT INTO EGYP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/christlegends_05_lagerlof_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10180","display_name":"Bob Scott"}]},{"id":"347194","section_number":"6","title":"IN NAZARETH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/christlegends_06_lagerlof_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10180","display_name":"Bob Scott"}]},{"id":"347195","section_number":"7","title":"IN THE TEMPLE","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347196","section_number":"8","title":"SAINT VERONICA\u2019S KERCHIEF - parts 1-3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347200","section_number":"9","title":"SAINT VERONICA\u2019S KERCHIEF - part 4-6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347202","section_number":"10","title":"SAINT VERONICA\u2019S KERCHIEF - part 7-9","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347197","section_number":"11","title":"ROBIN REDBREAST","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/christlegends_11_lagerlof_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10221","display_name":"David Lodes"}]},{"id":"347198","section_number":"12","title":"OUR LORD AND SAINT PETER","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347199","section_number":"13","title":"THE SACRED FLAME - parts 1-2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"347201","section_number":"14","title":"THE SACRED FLAME - part 3, 4, 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"39","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"},{"id":"44","name":"Religion"}],"translators":[{"id":"6660","first_name":" Velma Swanston","last_name":"Howard","dob":"1868","dod":"1937"}]}}}
