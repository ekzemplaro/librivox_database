{"books":{"20":{"id":"3155","title":"Malay Archipelago, Vol. 1","description":"<p>A classic of Victorian travel literature, influential to the Far Eastern adventure story as imagined by the West, a bedside favourite for Joseph Conrad. Yet as the full title suggests \"The Malay Archipelago, the land of the orang-utan, and the bird of paradise, a narrative of travel, with sketches of man and nature\" this is in fact a science journal written with little hyperbole. Like the man himself the style is one of modest narration and a keen eye. Unlike Charles Darwin, co-discoverer of evolution through natural selection, Wallace had to work for his living, as a collector of fauna to be sold as specimen types. His booty from eight years among the islands, listed in the Preface: \"310 specimens of Mammalia, 100 specimens of Reptiles, 8050 specimens of Birds, 7500 specimens of Shells, 13100 specimens of Lepidoptera, 83200 specimens of Coleoptera, 13400 specimens of other Insects. 125,660 specimens of natural history in all.\" (summary by David Higham).<p> ","url_text_source":"","language":"English","copyright_year":"1869","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3155","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Malay_Archipelago","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4452","first_name":" Alfred Russel","last_name":"Wallace","dob":"1823","dod":"1913"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"180712","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
