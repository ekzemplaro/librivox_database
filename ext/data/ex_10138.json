Sherman was one of the premier generals fighting for the North. In 1864, Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union commander in the western theater of the war. He proceeded to lead his troops to the capture of the city of Atlanta, a military success that contributed to the re-election of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Sherman's subsequent march through Georgia and the Carolinas further undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting. He accepted the surrender of all the Confederate armies in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida in April 1865. Sherman\u2019s scorched earth policy marching his army through Georgia from conquered Atlanta to coastal Savannah was a strong factor in breaking the South\u2019s will to fight. The South\u2019s surrender came just five months later. He steadfastly refused to be drawn into politics and in 1875 published his Memoirs, one of the best-known first-hand accounts of the American Civil War. British military historian B. H. Liddell Hart famously declared that Sherman was \"the first modern general\" ( Wikipedia and david wales)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4361","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"7","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10138","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/shermansmarchtothesea_1508_librivox\/shermansmarchtothesea_1508_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/shermans-march-to-the-sea-and-the-burning-of-columbia-south-carolina-from-his-memoirs-by-william-tecumseh-sherman\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:24:58","totaltimesecs":12298,"authors":[{"id":"10540","first_name":"William Tecumseh","last_name":"Sherman","dob":"1820","dod":"1891"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/shermansmarchtothesea_1508_librivox","sections":[{"id":"347643","section_number":"0","title":"Two Prefaces","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_00_sherman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"413","file_name":"shermansmarch_00_sherman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"347644","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 20 (Partial)  Atlanta And After \u2013 Pursuit of Hood \u2013 September and October 1864","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_01_sherman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"765","file_name":"shermansmarch_01_sherman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"347645","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 21 The March To The Sea From Atlanta To Savannah, November And December 1864 Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_02_sherman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1858","file_name":"shermansmarch_02_sherman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"347646","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 21 The March To The Sea From Atlanta To Savannah, November And December 1864 Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_03_sherman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1679","file_name":"shermansmarch_03_sherman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"347647","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 21 The March To The Sea From Atlanta To Savannah, November And December 1864 Part 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_04_sherman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2327","file_name":"shermansmarch_04_sherman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"347648","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 21 The March To The Sea From Atlanta To Savannah, November And December 1864 Part 4","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_05_sherman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1671","file_name":"shermansmarch_05_sherman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"347649","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 21 The March To The Sea From Atlanta To Savannah, November And December 1864 Part 5","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_06_sheman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1566","file_name":"shermansmarch_06_sheman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"347751","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 23 (Partial)  Campaign Of The Carolinas","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/shermansmarch_07_sherman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2019","file_name":"shermansmarch_07_sherman_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"73","name":"War & Military"},{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
