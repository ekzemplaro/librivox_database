{"books":{"37":{"id":"9652","title":"Kings, Queens and Pawns: An American Woman at the Front","description":"A personal account of the American author's visit to Europe in January 1915.  \"War is not two great armies meeting in a clash and frenzy of battle. It is much more than that. War is a boy carried on a stretcher, looking up at God's blue sky with bewildered eyes that are soon to close; war is a woman carrying a child that has been wounded by a shell; war is spirited horses tied in burning buildings and waiting for death; war is the flower of a race, torn, battered, hungry, bleeding, up to its knees in icy water; war is an old woman burning a candle before the Mater Dolorosa for the son she has given. For King and Country!\" M.R.R. from the introduction.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/14457","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"38","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9652","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"286","first_name":"Mary
