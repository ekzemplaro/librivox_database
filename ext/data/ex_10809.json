{"books":{"11":{"id":"10809","title":"Logic of Hegel","description":"This is the William Wallace translation of the first part of Hegel's Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences on logic.  This is an outline of Hegel's logical system that he would use and elaborate on during his lectures, it is a shorter version of his earlier publication The Science of Logic.  The William Wallace translation is very influential and famous for its clarity, although he took some liberties and does not always stick closely to Hegel's original text. - Summary by Ryan Smallwood","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/cu31924032296885","language":"English","copyright_year":"1892","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10809","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Encyclopedia_of_the_Philosophical_Sciences","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4604","first_name":" Georg Wilhelm Friedrich","last_name":"Hegel","dob":"1770","dod":"1831"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"367991","section_number":"0","title":"Bibliographical Notice","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/logicofhegel_00_hegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367992","section_number":"1","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/logicofhegel_01_hegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367993","section_number":"2","title":"Preliminary Notion","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/logicofhegel_02_hegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367994","section_number":"3","title":"First Attitude of Thought to Objectivity","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/logicofhegel_03_hegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367995","section_number":"4","title":"Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity - Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/logicofhegel_04_hegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"368407","section_number":"5","title":"Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity - Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/logicofhegel_05_hegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"368408","section_number":"6","title":"Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity - Part 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/logicofhegel_06_hegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367996","section_number":"7","title":"Third Attitude of Thought to Objectivity","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367997","section_number":"8","title":"Logic Further Defined and Divided","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367998","section_number":"9","title":"First Subdivision of Logic","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"367999","section_number":"10","title":"Second Subdivision of Logic","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]},{"id":"368000","section_number":"11","title":"Third Subdivision of Logic","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10784","display_name":"Ryan Smallwood"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"126","name":"Modern"}],"translators":[{"id":"11928","first_name":"William","last_name":"Wallace","dob":"1844","dod":"1897"}]}}}
