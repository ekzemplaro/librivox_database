{"books":{"16":{"id":"10865","title":"Agriculture for Beginners","description":"A textbook used by many public schools in the early 20th century. The authors believe that \"agriculture is eminently a teachable subject. They see no difference between teaching the child the fundamental principles of farming and teaching the same child the fundamental truths of arithmetic, geography, or grammar. They hold that a youth should be trained for the farm just as carefully as he is trained for any other occupation, and that it is unreasonable to expect him to succeed without training.\" - Summary by the authors","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/20772","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10865","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"12017","first_name":"Charles William","last_name":"Burkett","dob":"1873","dod":"1962"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"369909","section_number":"0","title":"Preface; To the Teacher","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/agricultureforbeginners_00_burkett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1472","display_name":"Sarah Jennings"}]},{"id":"369910","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1 - The Soil","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/agricultureforbeginners_01_burkett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10850","display_name":"Logan Lorenz"}]},{"id":"369911","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2 - The Soil and the Plant","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/agricultureforbeginners_02_burkett_edited.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10862","display_name":"polyglotreader2"}]},{"id":"369912","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3, Part 1 - The Plant","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"369913","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 3, Part 2 - The Plant","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"369914","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 4 - How to Raise a Fruit Tree","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/agricultureforbeginners_05_burkett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnnS"}]},{"id":"369915","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 5, Part 1 - Horticulture","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"369916","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 5, Part 2 - Horticulture","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"369917","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 6 - The Diseases of Plants","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10475","display_name":"Shelly Tumbleson"}]},{"id":"369943","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 7 - Orchard, Garden, and Field Insects","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"369944","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 8, Part 1 - Farm Crops","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1472","display_name":"Sarah Jennings"}]},{"id":"369945","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 8, Part 2 - Farm Crops","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnnS"}]},{"id":"369946","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 8, Part 3 - Farm Crops","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnnS"}]},{"id":"369947","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 9 - Feed Stuffs","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"369948","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 10 - Domestic Animals","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/agricultureforbeginners_14_burkett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnnS"}]},{"id":"369949","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter 11 - Farm Dairying","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/agricultureforbeginners_15_burkett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnnS"}]},{"id":"369950","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter 12 - Miscellaneous","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1472","display_name":"Sarah Jennings"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"96","name":"Nature"}],"translators":[]}}}
