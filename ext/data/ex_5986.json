{"books":{"20":{"id":"5986","title":"His First and Last Appearance","description":"The scene of the story is laid partly in Milwaukee, partly in New York. It describes the trials of the orphaned Lachance children. The boy hero is of a loving and lovable disposition and wins the hearts of all. The author has combined pathetic incidents with religious consolations, and gives zest to the whole by diffusing his genial humor throughout.<br><br>From the author of Tom Playfair, Percy Wynn, But Thy Love and thy Grace, and many more.
