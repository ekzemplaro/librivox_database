{"books":{"11":{"id":"8724","title":"Pope Pius the Tenth","description":"Pope Saint Pius X (2 June 1835 \u2013 20 August 1914), born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, was Pope from 4 August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was the first pope since Pius V (1566 to 1572) to be canonized. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to publish the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values.  - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/35953","language":"English","copyright_year":"1954","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8724","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pope_Pius_X","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"3580","first_name":"Francis Alice","last_name":"Forbes","dob":"1869","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"307056","section_number":"1","title":"Child and Student","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_01_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"307057","section_number":"2","title":"Curate and Parish Priest","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_02_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"307058","section_number":"3","title":"Canon and Bishop","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_03_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"307059","section_number":"4","title":"Patriarch of Venice","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_04_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"307060","section_number":"5","title":"The Papal Election","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_05_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"307061","section_number":"6","title":"The Aims of Pius X","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_06_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"307062","section_number":"7","title":"Pius X and France","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_07_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"307063","section_number":"8","title":"The Pope of the Eucharist","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_08_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"307064","section_number":"9","title":"Pius X and Modernism","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_09_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"307065","section_number":"10","title":"Pius X and the Priesthood","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9418","display_name":"Jia Jia Yong"}]},{"id":"307066","section_number":"11","title":"The Pope of the Suffering","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_11_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"307067","section_number":"12","title":"The Pope of Peace","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/popepius_12_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"64","display_name":"Robin Cotter"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"129","name":"Christianity - Biographies"}],"translators":[]}}}
