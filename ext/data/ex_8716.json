{"books":{"16":{"id":"8716","title":"O. Henry Memorial Award Prize Stories of 1921","description":"In 1918 the Society of Arts and Sciences established the O. Henry Memorial Awards to reward the very best short stories published during the previous year with cash prizes.   1921 was a particularly productive year with sterling and brilliantly varied examples of the art of short story writing as are included here.  The selection committee struggled to agree on these, but finally, here they are for us to enjoy and record.   The length varies but most are sufficiently long for a reader to get their teeth into and enjoy.   The stories are listed in a rough order of how they were judged, but all are excellent.     - Summary by Phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/11512","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8716","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"18","first_name":"","last_name":"Various","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"306898","section_number":"1","title":"THE HEART OF LITTLE SHIKARA","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_01_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"306899","section_number":"2","title":"THE MAN WHO CURSED THE LILIES","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_02_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3967","display_name":"Christine Dufour"}]},{"id":"306900","section_number":"3","title":"THE URGE","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_03_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3967","display_name":"Christine Dufour"}]},{"id":"306901","section_number":"4","title":"MUMMERY","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_04_various.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9237","display_name":"David Hinson"}]},{"id":"306902","section_number":"5","title":"THE VICTIM OF HIS VISION","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_05_various.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8522","display_name":"meridiculous"}]},{"id":"306903","section_number":"6","title":"MARTIN GERRITY GETS EVEN","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_06various.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9110","display_name":"Fred Sandal"}]},{"id":"306904","section_number":"7","title":"STRANGER THINGS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_section7_strangerthings.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9216","display_name":"Jothi Tharavant"}]},{"id":"306905","section_number":"8","title":"COMET","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_8_various.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9216","display_name":"Jothi Tharavant"}]},{"id":"306906","section_number":"9","title":"FIFTY-TWO WEEKS FOR FLORETTE","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_9_various.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6286","display_name":"Wendy Almeida"}]},{"id":"306907","section_number":"10","title":"WILD EARTH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_10_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"307070","section_number":"11","title":"WILD EARTH, part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_11_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"306908","section_number":"12","title":"THE TRIBUTE","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_12_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"306909","section_number":"13","title":"THE GET-AWAY","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"306910","section_number":"14","title":"\"AURORE.\"","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_14_various.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"306911","section_number":"15","title":"MR.
