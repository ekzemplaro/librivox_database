{"books":{"3":{"id":"6703","title":"Mr. Spaceship","description":"The war with the Yucks from Proxima Centauri was claimed to be a stalemate but they were really winning.  The mine belts they laid seemed to propagate themselves and were slowly strangling Terran planets. How did they do that? What was their secret?

But will a conscious warship do what the generals wish? Perhaps and perhaps something entirely surprising!
