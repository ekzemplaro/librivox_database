{"books":{"11":{"id":"8972","title":"Monarchia","description":"The De Monarchia is one of the main works by Dante Alighieri. It is a treatise on secular and religious power, and more specifically on the relationship between secular authority (represented by the Holy Roman Emperor) and religious authority (represented by the Pope).  The work is composed of three books, in which Dante condemns the theocratic conception of the power elaborated by the Roman Church and defends that both the Pope and the Emperor derive their power from God, and, that being so, God gave to each power in one certain area of life, which means they should not interfere with each other's power and one should not be considered above the other. - Summary by Leni","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/demonarchiadant00aliggoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8972","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/De_Monarchia","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1189","first_name":"Dante","last_name":"Alighieri","dob":"1265","dod":"1321"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"314575","section_number":"0","title":"Preface and Introduction","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"314576","section_number":"1","title":"Book I - Chapters I to IV (Introduction;
