{"books":{"11":{"id":"8972","title":"Monarchia","description":"The De Monarchia is one of the main works by Dante Alighieri. It is a treatise on secular and religious power, and more specifically on the relationship between secular authority (represented by the Holy Roman Emperor) and religious authority (represented by the Pope).  The work is composed of three books, in which Dante condemns the theocratic conception of the power elaborated by the Roman Church and defends that both the Pope and the Emperor derive their power from God, and, that being so, God gave to each power in one certain area of life, which means they should not interfere with each other's power and one should not be considered above the other. - Summary by Leni","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/demonarchiadant00aliggoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8972","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/De_Monarchia","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1189","first_name":"Dante","last_name":"Alighieri","dob":"1265","dod":"1321"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"314575","section_number":"0","title":"Preface and Introduction","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"314576","section_number":"1","title":"Book I - Chapters I to IV (Introduction; To what end does government exist among all men?; To actualize the whole capacity of the possible intellect in speculation and action.; To attain this end humanity requires universal peace.)","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/leni\/monarchia_01_alighieri_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9320","display_name":"Mickey T."}]},{"id":"314577","section_number":"2","title":"Book I - Chapters V to VIII (When several things are ordained for one end, one must rule and the others obey.; The order which is found in the parts of the human race should be found in the race as a whole.; The relation of kingdoms and nations to the monarch should be that of humanity to God.; Men are made in the image of God; but God is one.)
