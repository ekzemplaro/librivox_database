{"books":{"15":{"id":"3082","title":"Complete Hypnotism, Mesmerism, Mind-Reading and Spiritualism","description":"<P>Written in 1903, just sixty years after the word 'hypnotism' was coined, this book explores the contemporary understanding of the nature, uses and dangers of the technique. Hypnotism has been practiced for many centuries, but it was in the mid-to-late nineteenth century that it became a particularly fashionable way to explore the human mind. Although understanding of the subject has evolved considerably over subsequent years, this book remains a fascinating insight into a technique once thought to be at the forefront of medical science.<BR>(summary by Stuart Bell)<\/P>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/19342","language":"English","copyright_year":"1903","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3082","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/hypnotism_alpheus_0906_librivox\/hypnotism_alpheus_0906_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/complete-hypnotism-by-a-alpheus\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:48:41\r\nBoo","totaltimesecs":13721,"authors":[{"id":"5173","first_name":" A.","last_name":"Alpheus","dob":"?","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/hypnotism_alpheus_0906_librivox","sections":[{"id":"179150","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1252","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1870","display_name":"Stuart Bell"}]},{"id":"179151","section_number":"2","title":"02 - What is hypnotism?","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"714","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3828","display_name":"Maya"}]},{"id":"179152","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Theories of hypnotism","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"465","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1870","display_name":"Stuart Bell"}]},{"id":"179153","section_number":"4","title":"04 - How to hypnotize","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1120","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2159","display_name":"Matthew Westra"}]},{"id":"179154","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Amusing experiments","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"802","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2159","display_name":"Matthew Westra"}]},{"id":"179155","section_number":"6","title":"06 - The stages of hypnotism","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1500","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2159","display_name":"Matthew Westra"}]},{"id":"179156","section_number":"7","title":"07 - How the subject feels under hypnotization","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"648","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2159","display_name":"Matthew Westra"}]},{"id":"179157","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Self-hypnotization","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"665","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2159","display_name":"Matthew Westra"}]},{"id":"179158","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Simulation","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1099","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3925","display_name":"Viglione"}]},{"id":"179159","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Criminal suggestion","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"660","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3925","display_name":"Viglione"}]},{"id":"179160","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Dangers in being hypnotized","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"836","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1870","display_name":"Stuart Bell"}]},{"id":"179161","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Hypnotism in medicine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"947","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2159","display_name":"Matthew Westra"}]},{"id":"179162","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Hypnotism of animals","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"390","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"179163","section_number":"14","title":"14 - A scientific explanation","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"900","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3290","display_name":"Marian Martin"}]},{"id":"179164","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Telepathy and clairvoyance","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"798","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3717","display_name":"Elliott Miller"}]},{"id":"179165","section_number":"16","title":"16 - The confessions of medium","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"925","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3717","display_name":"Elliott Miller"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"100","name":"Psychology"},{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"}],"translators":[]}}}
