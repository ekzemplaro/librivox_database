Omar's Rubaiyat is a beautiful anthology of Islamic wisdom literature: originally penned in medieval Persian during the late 11th century AD. <\/p><p>\n\nThe best known English translations are those by Edward Fitzgerald: his fifth (and last) translation includes a mere 101 quatrains - a fraction of Omar's original work. Fitzgerald's selection loosely groups quatrains by theme; rendering quatrains into English as four-line, rhymed stanzas. <\/p>\n<p>\nOmar's writings are pervaded by the consciousness of the transient quality of life. In his Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, the author ponders the limits of human knowledge and morality: and confronts his readers point-blank with the difficult questions that challenge every generation: \n<\/p><br\/>\n- what is the ultimate benefit derived from human knowledge? <br\/>\n- given human mortality; is is best to guide our lives by the dictates of reason, or sensuality? <br\/>\n- what happens to my soul when I die? <br\/>\n- why did God - the Creator - give me existence? \n<br\/><p>\n(Introduction by Godsend)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/246","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4708","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox\/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-by-omar-khayyam-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:37:34","totaltimesecs":2254,"authors":[{"id":"1299","first_name":"Omar","last_name":"Khayy\u00e1m","dob":"1048","dod":"1131"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox&reCache=1","sections":[{"id":"45981","section_number":"1","title":"Quatrains 1-20","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"450","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"45982","section_number":"2","title":"Quatrains 21-40","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"441","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"45983","section_number":"3","title":"Quatrains 41-60","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"439","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"45984","section_number":"4","title":"Quatrains 61-80","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"452","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"45985","section_number":"5","title":"Quatrains 81-101","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"472","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[{"id":"6893","first_name":" Edward","last_name":"FitzGerald","dob":"1809","dod":"1883"}]}}}
