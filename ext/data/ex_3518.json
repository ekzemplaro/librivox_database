{"books":{"29":{"id":"3518","title":"Legends of Charlemagne","description":"<p>Bulfinch (July 15, 1796 - May 27, 1867) explains the his work is \"an attempt tell the stories of mythology in such a manner as to make them a source of amusement. We have endeavored to tell them correctly, according to the ancient authorities, so that when the reader finds them referred to he may not be at a loss to recognize the reference. Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study, but as a relaxation from study; to give our work the charm of a story-book, yet by means of it to impart a knowledge of an important branch of education.\"\n\nThe Bulfinch version of myth presents the myths in their literary versions, without unnecessary violence, sex, psychology or ethnographic information. The Bulfinch myths are an indispensable guide to the cultural values of the American 19th century.  (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n<br><br>This is the third of Bulfinch's series of three mythologies.
