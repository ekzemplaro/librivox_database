{"books":{"34":{"id":"7508","title":"Bill Nye's Funniest Thoughts","description":"Bill Nye was a famous American humor columnist in the middle 1800's. He said \"We can never be a nation of snobs so long as we are willing to poke fun at ourselves.\" And he did exactly that in hundreds of newspaper columns that were later collected into books.  This is a selection of just 35 of the most humorous, wry and downright funny cogitations of his, written of course in the somewhat convoluted style common in the 19th century which just adds to their flavor in my opinion.  The selection process was rigorous: only those that made me laugh, giggle or snort are included.
