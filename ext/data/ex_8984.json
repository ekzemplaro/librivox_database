{"books":{"2":{"id":"8984","title":"Cain: A Mystery","description":"<p>Cain: A Mystery is Lord Byron's retelling of the classical Biblical story from the point of view of its antagonist. Undoubtedly influenced by Milton's Paradise Lost, Byron's Cain is defiant and questioning. In trying to come to terms with the mortality humanity has been punished with, he comes face to face with Lucifer, who takes him to the \"Abyss of Space,\" shows him a vision of Earth's violent natural history, and gives him a true understanding of death. Upon his return, a devastated Cain carries out the familiar end of his tragedy. Cain: A Mystery is a closet drama, a popular form for Romantic writers, where the script is not intended to be performed onstage, but rather read aloud with a small group. - Summary by Sarah Terry<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/23475","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8984","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/cainamystery_1503_librivox\/cainamystery_1503_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cain_(play)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/cain-a-mystery-by-george-gordon-lord-byron\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:46:31","totaltimesecs":6391,"authors":[{"id":"39","first_name":"George Gordon, Lord","last_name":"Byron","dob":"1788","dod":"1824"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/cainamystery_1503_librivox","sections":[{"id":"314842","section_number":"1","title":"Act I","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/cain_1_byron_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2068","file_name":"cain_1_byron_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3157","display_name":"TriciaG"},{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"},{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"},{"reader_id":"6544","display_name":"Amanda Friday"},{"reader_id":"7170","display_name":"alanmapstone"},{"reader_id":"7679","display_name":"Libby Gohn"},{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"},{"reader_id":"9001","display_name":"Mary Kay"},{"reader_id":"9792","display_name":"Mike Cantrell"}]},{"id":"314843","section_number":"2","title":"Act II","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/cain_2_byron_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2220","file_name":"cain_2_byron_128kb.mp3","readers":[]},{"id":"314844","section_number":"3","title":"Act III","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/cain_3_byron_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2103","file_name":"cain_3_byron_128kb.mp3","readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"61","name":"Tragedy"}],"translators":[]}}}
