Her sensible father and uncle are in favour of the marriage; but unfortunately her father is under the thumb of his wife, Philaminte, Henriette's mother. And Philaminte, supported by Henriette's aunt and sister, wishes her to marry Trissotin, a \"scholar\" and mediocre poet with lofty aspirations, who has these three women completely in his thrall. For these three ladies are \"learned\"; their obsession in life is learning and culture of the most pretentious kind, and Trissotin is their special prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the fixture of their literary salon. - Summary by Wikipedia\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nArmande: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/6281\">Beth Thomas<\/a><br>Henriette: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/6544\">Amanda Friday<\/a><br>Clitandre: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/7601\">Malone<\/a><br>Belise: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/7679\">Libby Gohn<\/a><br>Ariste: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/8784\">Kingof192<\/a><br>Chrysale: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/6754\">ToddHW<\/a><br>Martine: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/8009\">Frances Brown<\/a><br>Philaminte: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/8337\">Claudia Salto<\/a><br>Trissotin: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/474\">Zachary Brewster-Geisz<\/a><br>Lepine: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/7848\">bala<\/a><br>Vadius: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/8291\">Elliot Gage<\/a><br>Julian: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/8693\">russellhughes<\/a><br>A Notary: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/8435\">Richard Friday<\/a><br>Narrator: <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/7708\">Savannah<\/a><br>Edited by <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/7026\">Michele Eaton<\/a><br><br>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8772","language":"English","copyright_year":"1672","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8168","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/learned_women_1403_librivox\/learned_women_1403_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Les_Femmes_Savantes","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-learned-women-by-moliere\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:45:09","totaltimesecs":6309,"authors":[{"id":"6282","first_name":"","last_name":"Moli\u00e8re","dob":"1622","dod":"1673"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/learned_women_1403_librivox","sections":[{"id":"293359","section_number":"1","title":"Act 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lezer\/learnedwomen_01_moliere_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1029","file_name":"learnedwomen_01_moliere_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"474","display_name":"Zachary Brewster-Geisz"},{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"},{"reader_id":"6544","display_name":"Amanda Friday"},{"reader_id":"6754","display_name":"ToddHW"},{"reader_id":"7601","display_name":"Malone"},{"reader_id":"7679","display_name":"Libby Gohn"},{"reader_id":"7708","display_name":"Savannah"},{"reader_id":"7848","display_name":"bala"},{"reader_id":"8009","display_name":"Frances Brown"},{"reader_id":"8291","display_name":"Elliot Gage"},{"reader_id":"8337","display_name":"Claudia Salto"},{"reader_id":"8435","display_name":"Richard Friday"},{"reader_id":"8693","display_name":"russellhughes"},{"reader_id":"8784","display_name":"Kingof192"}]},{"id":"293360","section_number":"2","title":"Act 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lezer\/learnedwomen_02_moliere_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1324","file_name":"learnedwomen_02_moliere_128kb.mp3","readers":[]},{"id":"293361","section_number":"3","title":"Act 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lezer\/learnedwomen_03_moliere_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1619","file_name":"learnedwomen_03_moliere_128kb.mp3","readers":[]},{"id":"293362","section_number":"4","title":"Act 4","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lezer\/learnedwomen_04_moliere_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1241","file_name":"learnedwomen_04_moliere_128kb.mp3","readers":[]},{"id":"293363","section_number":"5","title":"Act 5","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lezer\/learnedwomen_05_moliere_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1096","file_name":"learnedwomen_05_moliere_128kb.mp3","readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"60","name":"Satire"}],"translators":[{"id":"9957","first_name":"Charles Heron","last_name":"Wall","dob":"1836","dod":"1905"}]}}}
