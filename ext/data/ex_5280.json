This was the Weekly Poetry project for March 6th, 2011.<br><br>Benjamin Jonson was an English Renaissance dramatist, poet and actor. A contemporary of William Shakespeare, he is best known for his satirical plays, particularly Volpone, The Alchemist, and Bartholomew Fair, which are considered his best, and his lyric poems. A man of vast reading and a seemingly insatiable appetite for controversy, Jonson had an unparalleled breadth of influence on Jacobean and Caroline playwrights and poets. <br><br>To Celia is a poem first published after March 1616 by Ben Jonson. It was set to music after 1770, in the form of the song Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes, the poem's first line.(summary by Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/jonson01.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1616","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5280","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/to_celia_1103_librivox\/to_celia_1103_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/To_Celia","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/to-celia-by-ben-jonson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:12:41","totaltimesecs":761,"authors":[{"id":"1176","first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Jonson","dob":"1572","dod":"1637"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/to_celia_1103_librivox","sections":[{"id":"60213","section_number":"1","title":"To Celia - Read by ALG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"52","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4744","display_name":"Amy Gramour"}]},{"id":"60214","section_number":"2","title":"To Celia - Read by BRB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"53","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6063","display_name":"Bree Bossier"}]},{"id":"60215","section_number":"3","title":"To Celia - Read by CD","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"78","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2733","display_name":"CalmDragon"}]},{"id":"60216","section_number":"4","title":"To Celia - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"60217","section_number":"5","title":"To Celia - Read by DRB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"63","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"60218","section_number":"6","title":"To Celia - Read by GHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"63","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"60219","section_number":"7","title":"To Celia - Read by JCM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"58","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3470","display_name":"Jason Mills"}]},{"id":"60220","section_number":"8","title":"To Celia - Read by JOC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"71","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4015","display_name":"JimOCR"}]},{"id":"60221","section_number":"9","title":"To Celia - Read by LLW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"66","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"60222","section_number":"10","title":"To Celia - Read by LS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"64","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6147","display_name":"Liberty Stump"}]},{"id":"60223","section_number":"11","title":"To Celia - Read by RN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"72","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3465","display_name":"ravenotation"}]},{"id":"60224","section_number":"12","title":"To Celia - Read by WT","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"64","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5694","display_name":"Winston Tharp"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"27","name":"Romance"}],"translators":[]}}}
