{"books":[{"id":"2083","title":"Hymns to the Night","description":"<br \/>\"Hymns to the Night\" is the last published work of Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772-1801), the German philosopher and early Romantic poet whose pen name was simply \u201cNovalis\u201d. The work alternates poetry and prose, exploring a personal mythology of darkness and light, but it is also a free-associative chronicle of a young man rationalizing the untimely death of his fianc\u00e9. This version (1897) was translated by influential fantasy author and novelist George MacDonald, who cited it as a great \u2013 and early \u2013 inspiration. \"Hymns to the Night\" is also available to Librivox listeners in the original German.
