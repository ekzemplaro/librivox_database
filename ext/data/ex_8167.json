{"books":{"19":{"id":"8167","title":"Untilled Field","description":"George Moore, an Irish writer involved with the Celtic Revival was influenced by the French Realists and particularly by the work of \u00c9mile Zola. Often considered as the first modern Irish novelist he became involved with Lady Gregory and William Butler Yeats in the establishment of the Irish Literary Theatre. As part of his involvement with the Literary Revival, he wrote a set of short stories set in Ireland, drawn from his experiences growing up on his family\u2019s estates in Co. Mayo. The stories were intended to be translated into Irish as a part of a new tradition of Gaelic Literature. <br>\nThe stories were later published in English as The Untilled Field, in 1903. Moore was initially influenced by Ivan Turgenyev\u2019s collection of short stories, Tales of a Sportsman and in turn they are thought to have been an influence on James Joyce\u2019s Dubliners collection. Moore\u2019s stories look at Irish rural life at the end of the 19th Century and examines the role that the clergy played in the lives of those who remained after mass emigration denuded the Irish countryside.\n -
