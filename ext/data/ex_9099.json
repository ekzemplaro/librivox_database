{"books":{"99":{"id":"9099","title":"Bible For Young People Vol. 2","description":"\"The Bible for Young People tells the sweet and simple stories of the Bible in the Bible language, omitting only genealogies and doctrines, and whatever is generally regarded as unprofitable to young readers. Moreover, it is so divided into subjects, forming complete stories, that the child will be interested in every part of it. ...<br \/><br \/>\n\"Verse divisions have been disregarded, and a totally new system of chapters introduced in place of the familiar ones, and it is hoped that this novelty will give fresh interest to the old book. One of the features which will be appreciated is the table of contents, giving the subject of each book and its subdivisions, so that one may readily turn to any Bible story of which he is in search.<br \/><br \/>\n\"With great discrimination and sympathy, the compiler, Mrs. Joseph B. Gilder, has accomplished this task, and the book now stands as the embodiment of what is universally considered the best in the Bible for young people, \"best\" meaning here what is most suited to the minds of girls and boys and appropriate to their moral range.\" Volume 2 comprises the stories of the New Testament.  - Summary from Publisher's note<br \/><br
