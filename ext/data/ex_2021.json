{"books":{"5":{"id":"2021","title":"Adventures of Paddy Beaver","description":"<p>The Adventures of Paddy Beaver is another in the long list of children\u2019s books by the conservationist, Thornton W. Burgess. In this book, the industrious and clever Paddy Beaver, a newcomer to the Green Forest, has encounters with Sammy Jay, Jerry Muskrat, Ol\u2019 Man Coyote and other inhabitants of the Green Forest. Along the way, we learn how Paddy builds his dam and his house, and how he stores his food. We also learn little lessons about life, such as the importance of planning before doing, caring for Nature, trusting others, the benefits of working together and how wonderful it is to have a job one can sink one\u2019s teeth into.
