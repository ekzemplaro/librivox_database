Two others, \"Lights Out\" and \"Remarks about Kings,\" were read for me by Robert Underwood Johnson at the meeting of the American Academy in Boston, November, 1915, at which I was unable to be present.<br><\/br>\n\nThe rest of the verses were printed after I had resigned my diplomatic post and was free to say what I thought and felt, without reserve.<br><\/br>\n\nThe \"Interludes in Holland\" are thoughts of the peaceful things that will abide for all the world after we have won this war against war.<br><\/br>\n\nSYLVANORA, October 1, 1917. - Summary by  Henry Van
