{"books":{"17":{"id":"10009","title":"No Animal Food and Nutrition and Diet with Vegetable Recipes","description":"<br\/>Though little is known about its author, this is considered the first vegan cookbook ever written. At the time of its composition, the Vegetarian Society and other advocates of vegetarian diets were engaged in a debate about the inclusion of dairy and eggs in one's regime. This text declares, from the title to the footnotes, that the best diet is free from all animal products. The arguments span historical, physical, ethical, aesthetic, and economic considerations and conclude with practical advice that stands the test of time. An essential text for those interested in vegetarianism and animal rights.\n- Summary by Ben Adams<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/22829","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10009","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/noanimalfood_1507_librivox\/noanimalfood_1507_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/no-animal-food-and-nutrition-and-diet-with-vegetable-recipes-by-rupert-h-wheldon\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:38:41","totaltimesecs":13121,"authors":[{"id":"11451","first_name":"Rupert H.","last_name":"Wheldon","dob":"1883","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/noanimalfood_1507_librivox","sections":[{"id":"344085","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/noanimalfood_00_wheldon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"234","file_name":"noanimalfood_00_wheldon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9372","display_name":"Ben Adams"}]},{"id":"344086","section_number":"1","title":"No Animal Food Ch.
