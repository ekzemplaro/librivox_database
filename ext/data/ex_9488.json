{"books":{"25":{"id":"9488","title":"Soul of a People","description":"In The Soul of a People, Englishman H. Fielding explores the beliefs of the Burmese people. He offers an understandable, and yet thorough, explanation of Buddhism, and illustrates the many ways the people of Burma (Myanmar) live their faith. He also provides a glimpse into the folk-practices surrounding Nats--the spirits of individuals who have suffered traumatic deaths, who now seek peace among ancient trees. Fielding, who lived in Burma for many years, gives us an intimate, first-hand account of a people he came to admire. Although first published in 1898, it remains a pertinent and thought-provoking read.
