{"books":{"27":{"id":"6748","title":"Efficiency Expert","description":"Our hero, Jimmy Torrance, Jr., has a hard time finding suitable employment after a brilliant (athletically, at least) college career, despite all kinds of assistance from his friends in the underworld and the wealthy and sophisticated young woman with whom he falls in love. Set in contemporary America, mostly Chicago, this 1921 short novel is one of a handful of Burrough\u2019s works that does not take us to a fantasy or an exotic setting. (Delmar H.
