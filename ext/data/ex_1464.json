The following words have influenced many at the time, and are still thought to represent Brenner's literary \"will\": \"Life is bad, but always secret ... Death is bad. The world is conflicted, but also diverse, and sometimes beautiful. The world is miserable, but can also be wonderful. The nation of Israel, by the rules of logic, has no future. One must, nonetheless, work. So long as you have a soul, there are sublime acts and uplifting moments. Long live Hebrew human labor!\" (Summary by Omri Lernau)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/benyehuda.org\/brenner\/","language":"Hebrew","copyright_year":"1911","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1464","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox\/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/from-here-and-there-by-yosef-haim-brenner\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:01:15","totaltimesecs":28875,"authors":[{"id":"2333","first_name":"\u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05e8 Yosef Haim","last_name":"Brenner","dob":"1881","dod":"1921"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox","sections":[{"id":"145509","section_number":"1","title":"First Notebook","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1761","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145510","section_number":"2","title":"Second Notebook, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1100","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145511","section_number":"3","title":"Second Notebook, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1358","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145512","section_number":"4","title":"Second Notebook, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1321","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145513","section_number":"5","title":"Second Notebook, Part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1379","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145514","section_number":"6","title":"Second Notebook, Part 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1573","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145515","section_number":"7","title":"Third Notebook, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1359","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145516","section_number":"8","title":"Third Notebook, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1416","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145517","section_number":"9","title":"Third Notebook, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1485","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145518","section_number":"10","title":"Third Notebook, Part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1295","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145519","section_number":"11","title":"Third Notebook, Part 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1280","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145520","section_number":"12","title":"Fourth Notebook, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1870","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145521","section_number":"13","title":"Fourth Notebook, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2355","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145522","section_number":"14","title":"Fifth Notebook, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2196","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145523","section_number":"15","title":"Fifth Notebook, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1850","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145524","section_number":"16","title":"Sixth Notebook, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1330","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145525","section_number":"17","title":"Sixth Notebook, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1860","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145526","section_number":"18","title":"Sixth Notebook, Addendum, Parts 1 and 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1286","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]},{"id":"145527","section_number":"19","title":"Sixth Notebook, Addendum, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"801","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1574","display_name":"Omri Lernau"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"54","name":"Published 1900 onward"}],"translators":[]}}}
