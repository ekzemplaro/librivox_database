{"books":{"9":{"id":"1382","title":"Short Nonfiction Collection Vol. 002","description":"<p>A collection of ten short nonfiction works in the public domain.  The essays, speeches and reports included in this collection were independently selected by the readers, and the topics encompass history, politics, religion, science and humor.  Included in this collection are the \"Oath of Hippocrates\" and \"The Funeral Oration of Pericles\" along with Patrick Henry's \"The Call to Arms,\" and Jack London's eyewitness account of the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake in 1906.  On the lighter side, we have Jerome K. Jerome's \"Should Women Be Beautiful,\" a short address by Mark Twain to The Author's Club in NYC, and the anonymous \"Miseries,\" a lighthearted lament on subjects such as the difficulties of eating a peach gracefully in public and finding a suitable length of twine when you need one. In this collection you will also find \"A Free Man's Worship\" by Bertram Russell, \"Obstacle-Cause\" from \"Sophisms of the Protectionists\" by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, and an essay by T. H. Huxley on the science of palaeontology.  (summary by J. M.
