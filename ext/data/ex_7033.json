{"books":{"18":{"id":"7033","title":"Harrington","description":"<i>Harrington<\/i> follows the protagonist of the same name who tries to explore his memories in order to understand his views on Jews. It begins with Harrington's early images of Jews, which are formed by a collection stories told by his maid, of Simon the Jew. His parents further strengthen this image by rewarding Harrington's antisemitism. Only after going to public school and coming face to face with the bully Mowbray are Harrington's views on Jews changed. Mowbray's tormenting of a Jewish peddler Jacob causes this sudden shift in thinking. Then with the introduction of Berenice Montenero, an American Jew who moved to England with her wealthy father, all does not run smoothly.
