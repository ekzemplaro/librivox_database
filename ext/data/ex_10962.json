{"books":{"10":{"id":"10962","title":"To The Women of Australia","description":"A popular poet rather than a literary poet, in her poems she expresses sentiments of cheer and optimism in plainly written, rhyming verse. Her world view is expressed in the title of her poem \"Whatever Is\u2014Is Best\". \nShe made a very popular appearance during World War I in France, reciting her poem, The Stevedores (\"Here's to the Army stevedores, lusty and virile and strong...\") while visiting a camp of 9,000 US Army stevedores.
