{"books":{"29":{"id":"5874","title":"Red Room","description":"A young idealistic civil servant, Arvid Falk, leaves the drudgery of bureaucracy to become a journalist and author. As he explores various social activities \u2014 politics, publishing, theatre, philanthropy, and business \u2014 he finds more hypocrisy and corruption than he thought possible. He takes refuge with a group of \"bohemians\", who meet in a red dining room in Berns Salonger to discuss these matters.
