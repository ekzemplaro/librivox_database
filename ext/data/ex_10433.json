{"books":{"20":{"id":"10433","title":"Time and the Gods (version 2)","description":"Time and the Gods is the first book by Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin and others.  The book is a series of short stories linked by Dunsany's invented pantheon of deities who dwell in Peg\u0101na. It was preceded by his earlier collection The Gods of Peg\u0101na and followed by some stories in The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories.  The title is thought to have been influenced by Algernon Swinburne, who wrote the line \"Time and the Gods are at strife\" in his 1866 poem \u201cHymn to Proserpine.\u201d - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8183","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10433","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Time_and_the_Gods","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"17","first_name":"Lord","last_name":"Dunsany","dob":"1878","dod":"1957"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"356884","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356885","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356886","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356887","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356888","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356889","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356890","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356891","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356892","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356893","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356894","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356895","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356896","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356897","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356898","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356899","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356900","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356901","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356902","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356903","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"356904","section_number":"21","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"11","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
