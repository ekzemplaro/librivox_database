{"books":{"19":{"id":"213","title":"Country of the Pointed Firs","description":"<p>The Country of the Pointed Firs (1896) is considered Jewett\u2019s finest work, described by Henry James as her \u201cbeautiful little quantum of achievement.\u201d Despite James\u2019s diminutives, the novel remains a classic. Because it is loosely structured, many critics view the book not as a novel, but a series of sketches; however, its structure is unified through both setting and theme. Jewett herself felt that her strengths as a writer lay not in plot development or dramatic tension, but in character development. Indeed, she determined early in her career to preserve a disappearing way of life, and her novel can be read as a study of the effects of isolation and hardship on the inhabitants who lived in the decaying fishing villages along the Maine coast.<br \/>\n(summary from Gutenberg e-text)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/367","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/213","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/pointed_firs\/pointed_firs_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/country-of-the-pointed-firs-by-sarah-orne-jewett\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:25:23","totaltimesecs":15923,"authors":[{"id":"1685","first_name":"Sarah Orne","last_name":"Jewett","dob":"1849","dod":"1909"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/pointed_firs","sections":[{"id":"123598","section_number":"1","title":"The Return \/ Mrs. Todd","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"680","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"123600","section_number":"2","title":"The Schoolhouse","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"335","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"123601","section_number":"3","title":"At the Schoolhouse Window","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"403","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"123602","section_number":"4","title":"Captain Littlepage","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"859","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"398","display_name":"James Smith"}]},{"id":"123603","section_number":"5","title":"The Waiting Place","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"836","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"569","display_name":"Frank"}]},{"id":"123604","section_number":"6","title":"The Outer Island ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"417","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"137","display_name":"Stephan Gambke"}]},{"id":"123605","section_number":"7","title":"Green Island ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1318","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"123606","section_number":"8","title":"William","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"418","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"712","display_name":"Michael Shook"}]},{"id":"123607","section_number":"9","title":"Where Pennyroyal Grew","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"650","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"123608","section_number":"10","title":"The Old Singers","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"484","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"98","display_name":"Patricia Oakley"}]},{"id":"123609","section_number":"11","title":"A Strange Sail","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"824","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"203","display_name":"Marian Brown"}]},{"id":"123610","section_number":"12","title":"Poor Joanna","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1215","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"203","display_name":"Marian Brown"}]},{"id":"123611","section_number":"13","title":"The Hermitage","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"854","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"203","display_name":"Marian Brown"}]},{"id":"123612","section_number":"14","title":"On Shell-heap Island","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"478","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"203","display_name":"Marian Brown"}]},{"id":"123613","section_number":"15","title":"The Great Expedition","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"760","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"98","display_name":"Patricia Oakley"}]},{"id":"123614","section_number":"16","title":"A Country Road ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"822","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"203","display_name":"Marian Brown"}]},{"id":"123615","section_number":"17","title":"The Bowden Reunion","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1588","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"712","display_name":"Michael Shook"}]},{"id":"123616","section_number":"18","title":"The Feast\u2019s End","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"711","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"203","display_name":"Marian Brown"}]},{"id":"123617","section_number":"19","title":"Along Shore","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1711","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"123618","section_number":"20","title":"The Backward View","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"560","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
