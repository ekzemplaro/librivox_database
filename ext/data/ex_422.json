It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian general who served in the war. It is widely considered a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The History is divided into eight books. These book divisions are the work of editors in later antiquity.<\/p>\n<p>W. R. Connor [...] describes Thucydides as \"an artist who responds to, selects and skillfully arranges his material, and develops its symbolic and emotional potential.\"<br \/>\n(Summary from Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/7142","language":"English","copyright_year":"1874","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/422","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/history_peloponnesian_war_librivox\/history_peloponnesian_war_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-history-of-the-peloponnesian-war-by-thucydides\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"20:57.24","totaltimesecs":1257.24,"authors":[{"id":"2974","first_name":"","last_name":"Thucydides (\u0398\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03c5\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2)","dob":"c. 460 BC","dod":"c. 395 BC"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/history_peloponnesian_war_librivox","sections":[{"id":"126945","section_number":"1","title":"Book 1, ch. 01","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1875","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126946","section_number":"2","title":"Book 1, ch. 02","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2989","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126947","section_number":"3","title":"Book 1, ch. 03","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1995","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126948","section_number":"4","title":"Book 1, ch. 04","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2176","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126949","section_number":"5","title":"Book 1, ch. 05","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2739","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126950","section_number":"6","title":"Book 2, ch. 06","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3763","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126951","section_number":"7","title":"Book 2, ch. 07","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2296","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126952","section_number":"8","title":"Book 2, ch. 08","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3204","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"580","display_name":"Ryan"}]},{"id":"126953","section_number":"9","title":"Book 3, ch. 09","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3607","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"548","display_name":"Chris Mitchell"}]},{"id":"126954","section_number":"10","title":"Book 3, ch. 10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2681","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"56","display_name":"Kirsten Ferreri"}]},{"id":"126955","section_number":"11","title":"Book 3, ch. 11","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1950","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"581","display_name":"C.
