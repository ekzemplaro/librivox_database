{"books":{"27":{"id":"5735","title":"Messengers of Evil","description":"Fant\u00f4mas was introduced a few years after Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fant\u00f4mas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion.\nHe is totally ruthless, gives no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fant\u00f4mas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested rats, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.<br \/>Messengers of Evil begins when \u201c. . . Baroness de Vibray, well known in the Parisian world and among artists, whose generous patroness she was, has been found dead in the studio of the ceramic painter, Jacques Dollon.\u201d It ends with Fantomas' escape once again, and with Juve receiving a humiliating rebuke from the supreme head of the police detective department. But the chase has not ended. \n(Introduction by Wikipedia and Don Jenkins)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/28333","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"28","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5735","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/messengers_of_evil_1109_librivox\/messengers_of_evil_1109_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/messengers-of-evil-by-marcel-allain-and-pierre-souvestre\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"9:25:48","totaltimesecs":33948,"authors":[{"id":"1100","first_name":"Marcel","last_name":"Allain","dob":"1885","dod":"1969"},{"id":"6316","first_name":" Pierre","last_name":"Souvestre","dob":"1874","dod":"1914"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/messengers_of_evil_1109_librivox","sections":[{"id":"72247","section_number":"1","title":"01 - THE DRAMA OF THE RUE NORVINS","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1459","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5304","display_name":"Don W.
