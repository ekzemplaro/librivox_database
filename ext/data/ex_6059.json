This was the Weekly Poetry project for November 6th, 2011 to mark this year's festivals of remembrance.<br \/><br \/>Chapman's son Victor was the first American pilot to lose his life in aerial combat, while serving with the Escadrille Am\u00e9ricaine in the First World War. This poem  tells of the heartbreak of a bereaved father; the sentiment, though attributed to the son's dog, is familiar to all who have lost someone they loved, in peace or war.
