{"books":{"16":{"id":"3897","title":"Three Soldiers","description":"<p>Three Soldiers is a 1920 novel by the American writer and critic John Dos Passos. It is one of the key American war novels of the First World War, and remains a classic of the realist war novel genre. H.L. Mencken, then practicing primarily as an American literary critic, praised the book in the pages of the Smart Set. \"Until Three Soldiers is forgotten and fancy achieves its inevitable victory over fact, no war story can be written in the United States without challenging comparison with it--and no story that is less meticulously true will stand up to it. At one blast it disposed of oceans of romance and blather. It changed the whole tone of American opinion about the war; it even changed the recollections of actual veterans of the war. They saw, no doubt, substantially what Dos Passos saw, but it took his bold realism to disentangle their recollections from the prevailing buncombe and sentimentality.\" (Summary from Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/6362","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3897","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/three_soldiers_1011_librivox\/three_soldiers_1011_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Three_Soldiers","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/three-soldiers-by-john-dos-passos\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"14:38:37","totaltimesecs":52717,"authors":[{"id":"1422","first_name":"John Dos","last_name":"Passos","dob":"1896","dod":"1970"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/three_soldiers_1011_librivox","sections":[{"id":"23370","section_number":"1","title":"Section 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2861","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23371","section_number":"2","title":"Section 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2359","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23372","section_number":"3","title":"Section 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2043","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23373","section_number":"4","title":"Section 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3653","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23374","section_number":"5","title":"Section 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3154","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23375","section_number":"6","title":"Section 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2834","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23376","section_number":"7","title":"Section 7","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2718","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23377","section_number":"8","title":"Section 8","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2763","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23378","section_number":"9","title":"Section 9","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3030","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23379","section_number":"10","title":"Section 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2302","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23380","section_number":"11","title":"Section 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"4117","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23381","section_number":"12","title":"Section 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"4174","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23382","section_number":"13","title":"Section 13","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"4231","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23383","section_number":"14","title":"Section 14","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3120","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23384","section_number":"15","title":"Section 15","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3856","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23385","section_number":"16","title":"Section 16","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1941","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]},{"id":"23386","section_number":"17","title":"Section 17","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3561","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1492","display_name":"mb"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"18","name":"Historical Fiction"},{"id":"34","name":"War & Military Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
