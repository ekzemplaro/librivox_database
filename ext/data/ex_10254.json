The spirit of St Benedict's Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: pax (\"peace\") and the traditional ora et labora (\"pray and work\").(Introduction from Wikipedia) - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ruleourmostholy00benegoog","language":"Latin","copyright_year":"1875","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10254","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rule_of_Benedict","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"5764","first_name":"Saint","last_name":"Benedict of Nursia","dob":"480","dod":"547"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"351362","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Prologus, I, II, III","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_01_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351363","section_number":"2","title":"2 - IV, V, VI, VII","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_02_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351364","section_number":"3","title":"3 - VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351365","section_number":"4","title":"4 - XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, XXV, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351366","section_number":"5","title":"5 - XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XL, XLI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351367","section_number":"6","title":"6 - XLII, XLIII, XLIV, XLV, XLVI, XLVII, XLVIII, XLIX, L, LI, LII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351368","section_number":"7","title":"7 - LIII, LIV, LV, LVI, LVII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351369","section_number":"8","title":"8 - LVIII, LIX, LX, LXI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351370","section_number":"9","title":"9 - LXII, LXIII, LXIV, LXV, LXVI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351371","section_number":"10","title":"10 - LXVII, LXVIII, LXIX, LXX, LXXI, LXXII, LXXIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"130","name":"Christianity - Other"}],"translators":[]}}}
