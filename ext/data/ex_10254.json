{"books":{"9":{"id":"10254","title":"Regula Sancti Benedicti","description":"Quote: The Rule of Saint Benedict (Regula Benedicti) is a book of precepts written by St. Benedict of Nursia for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. Since about the 7th century it has also been adopted by communities of women. During the 1500 years of its existence, it has become the leading guide in Western Christianity for monastic living in community. The spirit of St Benedict's Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: pax (\"peace\") and the traditional ora et labora (\"pray and work\").(Introduction from Wikipedia) - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ruleourmostholy00benegoog","language":"Latin","copyright_year":"1875","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10254","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rule_of_Benedict","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"5764","first_name":"Saint","last_name":"Benedict of Nursia","dob":"480","dod":"547"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"351362","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Prologus, I, II, III","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_01_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351363","section_number":"2","title":"2 - IV, V, VI, VII","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_02_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351364","section_number":"3","title":"3 - VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_03_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351365","section_number":"4","title":"4 - XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, XXV, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_04_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351366","section_number":"5","title":"5 - XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XL, XLI","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_05_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351367","section_number":"6","title":"6 - XLII, XLIII, XLIV, XLV, XLVI, XLVII, XLVIII, XLIX, L, LI, LII","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/regulasanctibenedicti_06_st.benedictofnursia_128kb_.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351368","section_number":"7","title":"7 - LIII, LIV, LV, LVI, LVII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351369","section_number":"8","title":"8 - LVIII, LIX, LX, LXI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351370","section_number":"9","title":"9 - LXII, LXIII, LXIV, LXV, LXVI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]},{"id":"351371","section_number":"10","title":"10 - LXVII, LXVIII, LXIX, LXX, LXXI, LXXII, LXXIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7860","display_name":"bedwere"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"130","name":"Christianity - Other"}],"translators":[]}}}
