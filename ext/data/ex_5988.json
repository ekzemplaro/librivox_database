{"books":{"12":{"id":"5988","title":"Desert, Further Studies in Natural Appearances","description":"<em>The Desert <\/em>by John Charles Van Dyke, published in 1901, is a lush, poetic description of the natural beauty of the American Southwest. <em>\"What land can equal the desert with its wide plains, its grim mountains, and its expanding canopy of sky!\" <\/em>Van Dyke, a cultivated art historian, saw \"sublimity\" in the desert's \"lonely desolation,\" which previous generations had perceived only as a wasteland, and his book has a conservationist flavor which seems distinctly modern. <em>\"The deserts should never be reclaimed,\" <\/em>he writes.<em> \"They are the breathing spaces of the west and should be preserved for ever.\"<\/em> The changing colors of the sky, hills, and sand impress Van Dyke, as do the mirages. He celebrates the \"long overlooked commonplace things of nature\"-- cactus and grease wood, desert animals, and \"winged life,\" the birds and insects. His writing has a philosophical undertone.<em> \"Not in vain these wastes of sand ... simply because they are beautiful in themselves and good to look upon whether they be life or death.\" <\/em>Anyone who views with equal awe fiery sunrises and weeds growing out of pavement cracks will enjoy this reading of Van Dyke's <em>The Desert.<\/em>(Summary by Sue Anderson)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/furtherstudesert00vandrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5988","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/desert_studies_sa_librivox\/desert_studies_sa_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-desert-by-john-charles-van-dyke\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:56:18","totaltimesecs":21378,"authors":[{"id":"2525","first_name":"John Charles","last_name":"van Dyke","dob":"1861","dod":"1931"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/desert_studies_sa_librivox","sections":[{"id":"79100","section_number":"0","title":"00 -  Dedication-Preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"477","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79101","section_number":"1","title":"01 -  The Approach","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1925","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79102","section_number":"2","title":"02 -  The Make of the Desert","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1924","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79103","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Bottom of the Bowl","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1717","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79104","section_number":"4","title":"04 - The Silent River","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1205","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79105","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Light, Air, and Color","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1566","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79106","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Desert Sky and Clouds","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1249","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79107","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Illusions","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1733","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79108","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Cactus and Greasewood","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2048","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79109","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Desert Animals","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2126","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79110","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Winged Life","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1800","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79111","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Mesas and Foot-Hills","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1716","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"79112","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Mountain - Barriers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1892","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"96","name":"Nature"},{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"}],"translators":[]}}}
