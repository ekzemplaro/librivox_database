{"books":{"29":{"id":"214","title":"Crome Yellow","description":"<p><i>Crome Yellow<\/i>, published in 1921 was Aldous Huxley\u2019s first novel. In it he satirizes the fads and fashions of the time. It is the witty story of a house party at \u2018Crome\u2019 where there is a gathering of bright young things. We hear some of the history of the house from Henry Wimbush, its owner and self appointed historian; Apocylapse is prophesied, virginity is lost, and inspirational aphorisms are gained in a trance. Our hero, Denis, tries to capture it all in poetry and is disappointed in love.<\/p>\n<p>The author, Aldous Huxley, was born in 1894 and began writing poetry and short stories in his early twenties; this was his first novel and established his literary reputation.
