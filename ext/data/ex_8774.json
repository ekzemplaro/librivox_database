{"books":{"10":{"id":"8774","title":"Delight in Disorder","description":"Robert Herrick (baptised 24 August 1591 \u2013 buried 15 October 1674[1]) was a 17th-century English lyric poet and cleric. He is best known for his book of poems, Hesperides.\nHerrick never married, and none of his love-poems seem to connect directly with any one beloved woman. He loved the richness of sensuality and the variety of life, and this is shown vividly in such poems as Cherry-ripe, Delight in Disorder and Upon Julia\u2019s Clothes.
