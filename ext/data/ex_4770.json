{"books":{"9":{"id":"4770","title":"Journey of Alvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca","description":"Few stories of shipwreck and survival can equal that of the 16th century Spaniard Alvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca who, cast ashore near present day (USA) Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1528, survived eight years of hand-to-mouth existence among the Indians of the South and Southwest, and who walked on foot across the plains to the Pacific Coast, arriving in Mexico in 1536. In 1542 he published an account of his adventures, and the present reading is based on Fanny Bandelier\u2019s English translation of that text.<br><br>\n\nCabeza de Vaca, along with three other survivors, two Spaniards and a North African (Est\u00e9vanico, a black slave) endured incredible hardships. Cabeza da Vaca was, himself, at first enslaved by the Indians, forced to dig roots with his bare hands for food. However, he soon showed powers of adaptation that allowed him to survive. He became a trader, bartering \u201cseashells and cockles\u201d from the coast for hides, red ochre, flint, and deer hair tassels from the inland tribes. \u201cTrade suited me well,\u201d he writes, \u201cbecause it gave me liberty to go where I pleased.\u201d The Indians \u201crejoiced greatly when seeing me and I would bring them what they needed, and those who did not know me would desire and endeavor to meet me for sake of my fame.\u201d Cabeza de Vaca\u2019s \u201cfame\u201d soon grew to include a reputation as a healer. In return for his \u201ccures,\u201d the Indians gave him \u201call that they had,\u201d which included food, often in perilously short supply.<br><br>\n\nThe success of the survivors\u2019 final overland treck in search of Spanish settlement reflected their comprehension of Indian customs and values. They were passed along from one tribe to another, accompanied by an ontourage of friendly natives. At each stop, Cabeza de Vaca saw to it that the food and presents he received were distributed to his followers by their chiefs, thus ensuring their loyalty.<br><br>\n\nAfter eight years among the Indians, Cabeza de Vaca had a hard time adjusting to \u201ccivilization.\u201d He writes that the Spanish governor in Mexico \u201creceived us very well, giving us what he had, for us to dress in; but for many days I could bear no clothing, nor could we sleep except on the bare floor.\u201d His first person narrative is an exciting tale of survival \u201cagainst the odds.\u201d<br>\n(Introduction by Sue Anderson)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/journeyofalvarn00nuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4770","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/journey_of_cabeza_de_vaca_sa_librivox\/journey_of_cabeza_de_vaca_sa_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-journey-of-alvar-nunez-cabeza-de-vaca-by-alvar-nunez-cabeza-de-vaca\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:19:09","totaltimesecs":15549,"authors":[{"id":"5620","first_name":"Alvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de","last_name":"Vaca","dob":"c. 1488","dod":"1558"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/journey_of_cabeza_de_vaca_sa_librivox","sections":[{"id":"47430","section_number":"0","title":"Chapter 0","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1441","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47431","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1311","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47432","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1645","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47433","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1504","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47434","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1813","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47435","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1677","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47436","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1585","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47437","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1441","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47438","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1454","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"47439","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1678","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"87","name":"History "},{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"}],"translators":[{"id":"6900","first_name":" Fanny","last_name":"Bandelier","dob":"1869","dod":"1936"}]}}}
