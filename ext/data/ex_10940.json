{"books":{"19":{"id":"10940","title":"Thunderstorm at Night","description":"George Eric Mackay was an English minor poet, now remembered as the sponging half-brother of Marie Corelli, the best-selling novelist. Mackay and Corelli, born Mary Mackay, were the children of Charles Mackay, by different mothers.\n\nAs a poet he is described as \"execrable\", and reliant on Corelli's promotion of his works. Mackay achieved some reputation in his time for Letters of a Violinist (1886). It sold 35,000 copies; he repaid Corelli's efforts by implying he wrote her novels. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/37649","language":"English","copyright_year":"1894","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10940","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2329","first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Mackay","dob":"1851","dod":"1898"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"372233","section_number":"1","title":"A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thunderstorm_mackay_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"372232","section_number":"2","title":"A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by GC","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thunderstorm_mackay_gc_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5890","display_name":"GabrielleC"}]},{"id":"372230","section_number":"3","title":"A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thunderstorm_mackay_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"372231","section_number":"4","title":"A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by MSD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thunderstorm_mackay_msd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10891","display_name":"Matthew Datcher"}]},{"id":"372234","section_number":"5","title":"A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by SABT","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thunderstorm_mackay_sabt_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8932","display_name":"SkyAlbatross"}]},{"id":"372235","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372236","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372237","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372238","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372239","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372240","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372241","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372242","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372243","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372244","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372245","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372246","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372247","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372248","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"372249","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
