{"books":{"13":{"id":"10940","title":"Thunderstorm at Night","description":"George Eric Mackay was an English minor poet, now remembered as the sponging half-brother of Marie Corelli, the best-selling novelist. Mackay and Corelli, born Mary Mackay, were the children of Charles Mackay, by different mothers.\n\nAs a poet he is described as \"execrable\", and reliant on Corelli's promotion of his works. Mackay achieved some reputation in his time for Letters of a Violinist (1886). It sold 35,000 copies; he repaid Corelli's efforts by implying he wrote her novels. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/37649","language":"English","copyright_year":"1894","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10940","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox\/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-thunderstorm-at-night-by-eric-mackay\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:17:10","totaltimesecs":1030,"authors":[{"id":"2329","first_name":"Eric","last_name":"Mackay","dob":"1851","dod":"1898"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"372237","section_number":"1","title":"A Thunderstorm at Night -
