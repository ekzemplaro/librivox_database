Manasseh\u2019s evil ways are recorded in 2 Kings 21:1-18, and the account of his repentance is recorded in 2 Chronicles 33:10-17. The Prayer of Manasses is held to be a deuterocanonical book by many Christians and is held to be Apocryphal by others. This reading is from the Holy Bible, King James Version 1611 which contains the Apocrypha separate from both the Old and New Testament. -- Summary by David Shamp<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/124","language":"English","copyright_year":"1611","num_sections":"1","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1256","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/prayer_manasses_ds_librivox\/prayer_manasses_ds_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-prayer-of-manasses-kjv\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:03:33","totaltimesecs":213,"authors":[{"id":"950","first_name":"","last_name":"King James Version (KJV)","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/prayer_manasses_ds_librivox","sections":[{"id":"141796","section_number":"1","title":"Prayer of Manasses","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"213","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1645","display_name":"David Shamp"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"139","name":"King James Version"}],"translators":[]}]}
