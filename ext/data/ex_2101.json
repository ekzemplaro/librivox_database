{"books":{"14":{"id":"2101","title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (version 4)","description":"Shakespeare's sequence of 154 sonnets deals with such themes as love, time, death, immortality, lust, and sex. The poems follow but also depart from the Petrarchan tradition of sonnets written by a frustrated male lover to an unattainable idealized female beloved. Shakespeare's sonnets are addressed to both male and female lovers: the androgynous \"young man\" and the alluring yet dangerously sexual \"dark lady.\" (Summary by Elizabeth Klett)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1041","language":"English","copyright_year":"1609","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2101","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/sonnets_etk_librivox\/sonnets_etk_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shakespeare's_sonnets","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/sonnets-by-william-shakespeare-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:28:50","totaltimesecs":8930,"authors":[{"id":"37","first_name":"William","last_name":"Shakespeare","dob":"1654","dod":"1616"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/sonnets_etk_librivox","sections":[{"id":"158227","section_number":"1","title":"Sonnets 1-10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"566","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158228","section_number":"2","title":"Sonnets 11-20","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"595","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158229","section_number":"3","title":"Sonnets 21-30","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"568","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158230","section_number":"4","title":"Sonnets 31-40","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"606","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158231","section_number":"5","title":"Sonnets 41-50","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"600","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158232","section_number":"6","title":"Sonnets 51-60","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"600","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158233","section_number":"7","title":"Sonnets 61-70","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"577","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158234","section_number":"8","title":"Sonnets 71-80","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"584","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158235","section_number":"9","title":"Sonnets 81-90","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"584","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158236","section_number":"10","title":"Sonnets 91-100","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"586","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158237","section_number":"11","title":"Sonnets 101-110","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"580","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158238","section_number":"12","title":"Sonnets 111-120","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"568","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158239","section_number":"13","title":"Sonnets 121-130","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"564","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158240","section_number":"14","title":"Sonnets 131-140","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"577","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"158241","section_number":"15","title":"Sonnets 141-154","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"775","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
