Deep in the catacombs of the Paris Opera House, there lurks a mysterious being who alternately directs and terrorises the Opera Populaire . . . until his growing obsession with the Opera's ingenue, Christine Daae, impels him to greater and more insane acts of terror, murder, and mayhem. Can Christine escape his clutches, or is she doomed to stay forever in the Phantom's underground lair?
