{"books":{"22":{"id":"10373","title":"Early Lives of Dante","description":"This recording contains two early biographies of Dante, both written by notable Florentine literati.<br>\nGiovanni Boccaccio (1313 -1375) was an Italian poet, most famous for his monumental collection of tales, The Decameron. Like Dante, Boccacio was one of the first writers to use the Italian vernacular.<br>\nLionardo Bruni (Aretino) (1369- 1444) was an accredited historian and man of letters. His short biography was inspired by reading the version of Dante's life by Boccaccio, who he considered had mispresented Dante by over-emphasizing the influence of his association with Beatrice.<br>\nIn his collection Wicksteed also included short articles wrtten by the Florentine banker and diplomat Giovanni Villani (c. 1276 \u2013 1348), his nephew, the historian Filippo Villani (fl. 15th century) and Boccaccio.\n(Summary by Algy Pug) ","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/earlylivesofdant00wickuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10373","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"3201","first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Boccaccio","dob":"1313","dod":"1375"},{"id":"11667","first_name":"Leonardo","last_name":"Bruni","dob":"1369","dod":"1444"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"354691","section_number":"1","title":"Preface and introduction","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354692","section_number":"2","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - Proem","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354693","section_number":"3","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - Dante\u2019s Birth and Studies","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354822","section_number":"4","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - His Love of Beatrice, and his Marriage","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354821","section_number":"5","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - His  Family Cares, Honours and Exile","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354823","section_number":"6","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - His Death and Funeral Honours","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354824","section_number":"7","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - Denunciation of the Florentines","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354825","section_number":"8","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - His Appearance, Habits and Character","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354826","section_number":"9","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - Digression concerning Poesy","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354827","section_number":"10","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - The difference between Poesy and Theology","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354828","section_number":"11","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - The Laurel granted to Poets","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354829","section_number":"12","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - Dante\u2019s Excellencies and Defects","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354830","section_number":"13","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - Diverse Works written by Dante","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354831","section_number":"14","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante - Incidents that came to pass concerning the Divine Comedy","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354832","section_number":"15","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante -Dante's Use of the vernacular","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354833","section_number":"16","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante -The De Monarchia and other Works","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"354834","section_number":"17","title":"Boccaccio - Encomium on Dante -The Dream of Dante\u2019s Mother.
