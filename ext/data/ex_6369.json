{"books":{"25":{"id":"6369","title":"Adventures of Reddy Fox","description":"This timeless story tells of an overconfident little fox who steals a plump pet hen and is hotly pursued by Farmer Brown's boy and Bowser the Hound. Children will delight in Reddy's risky antics and the commotion his behavior causes among the other woodland creatures. Grandma Fox tries her best to teach him and Reddy tries very hard to be good but his curiosity is always finding ways to get him into even more trouble. All the animals talk in this book so if you have always wanted to be a rabbit or a fox or a badger, this is your chance to enjoy the experience. Sections are very short, usually only a few hundred words or so. \n\nThornton Burgess was a conservationist who loved the beauty of nature and its living creatures so much that he wrote about them for 50 years in books and his newspaper column, Bedtime Stories.
