It is a letter from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paul_of_Tarsus\">Paul of Tarsus<\/a> to a number of early Christian communities in the Roman province of Galatia in central Anatolia. It is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law within Early Christianity.
