{"books":{"13":{"id":"4103","title":"Janet of the Dunes","description":"<p>Known primarily for her children's books, Harriet T. Comstock would occasionally depart from that genre and showcase her writing talent in adult prose as well. Janet of the Dunes is one such departure wherein she masterfully takes us into the lives of the bold men and women who tended those life saving stations along the seaboard which many a ship relied upon for their safety. They were simple people, large of heart and as close-knit as a tiny community can and must ever be, and they, above all else, took their duties very seriously. The story revolves primarily around Janet and her \"Cap'n Billy Daddy\" and how their lives and their devotion to one another are touched by the others within the small circle of people of the dunes, the hills, and the light.
