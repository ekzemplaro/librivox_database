{"books":{"27":{"id":"4380","title":"Riddle of the Frozen Flame","description":"<br \/>Another full-length mystery story featuring Hamilton Cleek, whom we met first in <a href=\"http:\/\/librivox.org\/cleek-the-man-of-the-forty-faces-by-thomas-w-hanshew\/\"><i>Cleek: The Man of the Forty Faces<\/i><\/a>. This time, Cleek investigates the sinister disappearance of people and the mysterious appearance of flames at night in the desolate Fens, and his friend Superintendent Narkom of Scotland Yard tries to solve some tricky cases of bank robberies in London.<br \/><br \/>While not quite up to the standard we have come to expect from previous Cleek adventures, it is still quite a jolly romp, and Cleek's cockney sidekick Dollops is always good fun.
