{"books":{"21":{"id":"9924","title":"Wood Folk at School","description":"The unique merit of this nature student rests in his fascinating style of writing, which invariably interests young and old; for without this element his pioneer work in the realm of nature would now be familiar only to scientists.\n\nThe title of this book suggests the central thought about which the author has grouped some of his most fascinating animal studies. To him \"summer wilderness is one vast schoolroom in which a multitude of wise, patient mothers are teaching their little ones the things they must know in order to hold their place in the world and escape unharmed from a hundred dangers.\" This unique book is a pleasure to read for young and old. - Summary by Wood Folk at School advertisement and
