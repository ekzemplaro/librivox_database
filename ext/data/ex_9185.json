{"books":{"14":{"id":"9185","title":"Uncle's Dream","description":"<i>Uncle\u2019s Dream<\/i> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky was written following his five year exile to Siberia where he was sent to serve in a hard labor camp.  Following what could only have been a harrowing and harsh existence in Russia\u2019s infamous prison for political and social prisoners, one would expect Dostoyevsky\u2019s work to have been dark and bitter.  Rather, <i>Uncle\u2019s Dream <\/i>is a humorous and yet scathing commentary on Russian provincial high-society.<br><br>The story of elderly Prince K. who comes to visit the town of Mordasoff, lorded over by the imperious Maria Alexandrovna, is one of love, hate, deceit and greed.  Standing reluctantly at Maria Alexandrovna\u2019s side is her haughty daughter, Zina, who has few friends of her own. The prince\u2019s companion and distant relative is Paul Mosgliakoff, suitor to Zina.<br><br>Maria Alexandrovna and Zina are the central characters in the charade to lure the senile prince into a marriage of convenience (not for him but for Maria Alexandrovna and Zina).  They, and a host of lesser characters, are brought to life in full color by Dostoyevsky\u2019s masterful wordsmithing.  <i>Uncle\u2019s Dream <\/i>is a must listen for any fan of not only Dostoyevsky, but of Russian literature and the \u201cgoings-on\u201d of the Russian \u201cupper crust.\u201d (Summary by Greg Giordano)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/38241","language":"English","copyright_year":"1888","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9185","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/unclesdream_1412_librivox\/unclesdream_1412_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uncle's_Dream","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/uncles-dream-by-fyodor-dostoyevsky\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"06:04:46","totaltimesecs":21886,"authors":[{"id":"439","first_name":"Fyodor","last_name":"Dostoyevsky","dob":"1821","dod":"1881"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/unclesdream_1412_librivox","sections":[{"id":"320060","section_number":"1","title":"CHAPTER
