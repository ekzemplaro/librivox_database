{"books":{"3":{"id":"6736","title":"Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m (Le Gallienne)","description":"Richard le Gallienne was an English poet and critic, who, although unfamiliar with the Persian language, had a profound interest in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. In 1897 he published a collection of 211 quatrains, which was based on earlier English translations, in particular the prose version by Justin Huntly McCarthy. A expanded edition, containing fifty additional quatrains was published in 1901, and this has been used for the present recording.
