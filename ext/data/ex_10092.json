Now he found himself wanting to share his success with some deserving soul, and one day found a young dying woman to whom he seemed inexplicably drawn. However he had a past which his conscience told him must be revealed in order for him to be worthy of a dying woman's love. Should a man of means expend the effort to clear his conscience in order to attempt a relationship destined to last but a short time? - Summary by Roger Melin<\/p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/samlawsonold00stowrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1898","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10092","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/spirit_of_sweetwater_1507_librivox\/spirit_of_sweetwater_1507_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-spirit-of-sweetwater-by-hamlin-garland\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:54:27","totaltimesecs":6867,"authors":[{"id":"884","first_name":"Hamlin","last_name":"Garland","dob":"1860","dod":"1940"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/spirit_of_sweetwater_1507_librivox","sections":[{"id":"346477","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1, Chapter 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/spiritofsweetwater_1_garland.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1012","file_name":"spiritofsweetwater_01_garland_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"346478","section_number":"2","title":"Part 1, Chapter 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/spiritofsweetwater_2_garland.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1326","file_name":"spiritofsweetwater_02_garland_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"346479","section_number":"3","title":"Part 2, Chapter 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/spiritofsweetwater_3_garland.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1241","file_name":"spiritofsweetwater_03_garland_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"346480","section_number":"4","title":"Part 2, Chapter 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/spiritofsweetwater_4_garland.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"669","file_name":"spiritofsweetwater_04_garland_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"346481","section_number":"5","title":"Part 3, Chapter 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/spiritofsweetwater_5_garland.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2111","file_name":"spiritofsweetwater_05_garland_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"346482","section_number":"6","title":"Part 3, Chapter 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/spiritofsweetwater_6_garland.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"508","file_name":"spiritofsweetwater_06_garland_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"53","name":"Published 1800 -1900"}],"translators":[]}}}
