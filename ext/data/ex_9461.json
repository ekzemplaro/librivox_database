{"books":{"3":{"id":"9461","title":"Christmas Carol - Condensed by the Author for his Dramatic Readings","description":"This very special abridged version was written and performed by Dickens himself during his American Tour of 1862. Without the more terrifying and dark elements of the full length novel, its hour and a half length, and its lighter, comedic style makes this a family listening experience suited for all ages.
