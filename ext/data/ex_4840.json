{"books":{"3":{"id":"4840","title":"One-Hoss Shay","description":"<p>This is a small collection of whimsical poems by the American physician and author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.  \"The Deacon's Masterpiece\" describes the \"logical\" outcome of building an object (in this case, a two-wheeled carriage called a shay) that has no weak points.  The economic term \"one hoss shay,\" referring to a certain model of depreciation, derives its name from this poem.  \"How the Old Horse Won the Bet\" is a lighthearted look at a horse race.  Finally, \"The Broomstick Train\" is a wonderfully Halloween-y explanation of how an electric tram really works.
