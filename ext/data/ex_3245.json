{"books":{"12":{"id":"3245","title":"Buttered Side Down","description":"\"And so,\" the story writers used to say, \"they lived happily ever after.\"<br \/><br \/>Um-m-m\u2014maybe. After the glamour had worn off, and the glass slippers were worn out, did the Prince never find Cinderella's manner redolent of the kitchen hearth; and was it never necessary that he remind her to be more careful of her finger-nails and grammar? After Puss in Boots had won wealth and a wife for his young master did not that gentleman often fume with chagrin because the neighbors, perhaps, refused to call on the lady of the former poor miller's son? <br \/><br \/>It is a great risk to take with one's book-children.
