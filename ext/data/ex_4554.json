{"books":{"79":{"id":"4554","title":"Orley Farm","description":"<p>Orley Farm is Trollope at his best (as good as the Barsetshire series), which means some of the best characterizations in the English language. Trollope's people are real; the beleaguered Lady Mason, charged with forging a will; the aged lover Sir Peregrine Orme; Madeleine Stavely, deeply but practically in love; the shallow, fickle Sophia Furnival and others are 3-dimensional figures that live and breathe. His satire of the so-called \"justice\" system is the best kind of satire: he just describes the court proceedings as they really are. The result is as up-to-date as today's newspaper.
