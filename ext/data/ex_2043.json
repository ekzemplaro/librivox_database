{"books":{"15":{"id":"2043","title":"Futility, Or the Wreck of the Titan","description":"<p>This novel was published a full 14 years before the sinking of the Titanic, but listeners may be surprised at how many parallels this fictional tale has with subsequent true events.<br \/><br \/>The Titan is the largest and most technologically advanced steamship of her time. She is considered unsinkable. Her full speed crossings of the Northern Lane Route carry her rich passengers in the highest standards of luxury and comfort. The less well-off travel in rougher quarters but still benefit from the speed of travel. These crossings, however, are fraught with navigational hazards, the greatest of which is ice.<br \/><br \/>Unlike the ship, one member of her crew is not of the highest standard. At least, not anymore. John Rowland is a broken man who drinks to forget his past. However, when the Titan crashes into an iceberg during her attempt to break a speed record, he is forced to confront his past. Can he overcome his enemies and escape as the ship begins to sink? And can he make his way back to civilization and find self-respect once more? Adventure and soul-searching await Rowland, with a surprise ending.<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/24880","language":"English","copyright_year":"1898","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2043","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/futility_tw_librivox\/futility_tw_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Futility,_or_the_Wreck_of_the_Titan","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/futility-or-the-wreck-of-the-titan-by-morgan-robertson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:35:37","totaltimesecs":9337,"authors":[{"id":"4760","first_name":" Morgan","last_name":"Robertson","dob":"1861","dod":"1915"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/futility_tw_librivox","sections":[{"id":"157363","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapter One","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"423","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157364","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Chapter Two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"565","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157365","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Chapter Three","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"464","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157366","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Chapter Four","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"598","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157367","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Chapter Five","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"380","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157368","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Chapter Six","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1007","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157369","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Chapter Seven","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"658","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157370","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Chapter Eight","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"567","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157371","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Chapter Nine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"675","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157372","section_number":"10","title":"10- Chapter Ten","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"596","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157373","section_number":"11","title":"11- Chapter Eleven","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"767","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157374","section_number":"12","title":"12- Chapter Twelve","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"659","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157375","section_number":"13","title":"13- Chapter Thirteen","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"652","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157376","section_number":"14","title":"14- Chapter Fourteen","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"414","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157377","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Chapter Fifteen","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"556","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"157378","section_number":"16","title":"16- Chapter Sixteen","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"204","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"23","name":"Nautical & Marine Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
