His father is a keen naturalist who, some years before had set off for New Guinea in search of specimens, and never been heard of again. Joe is old enough to mount a search expedition, and takes with him a local doctor and an aboriginal worker on his farm. They find themselves joined by a stowaway, Jimmy, whose father is a squatter (farmer) nearby, together with his dog, Gyp. \nThis team sets off, arrive in New Guinea, hire some more porters, and travel

close shaves and tense moments, but finally they achieve their end, and return home triumphantly:
