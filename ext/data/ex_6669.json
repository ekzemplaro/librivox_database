{"books":{"18":{"id":"6669","title":"Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac","description":"Do you love books? No, I mean REALLY love books? These series of sketches on the delights, adventures, and misadventures connected with bibliomania (bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania.). The author wholeheartedly enjoyed this pursuit all his life and his descriptions are delightful to read. Anyone who has lovingly held a book, smelled it, and enjoyed it for being just what it is, will understand what the author puts so well. According to the author, collectors may be grouped in three classes: Those who collect from vanity, those who collect for the benefits of learning and those who collect out of veneration and love for books. Mr. Field fell squarly in the latter category.\n\nSummary from the preface and Phil Chenevert) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/443","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6669","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/loveaffairsofbibliomaniac_1206_librivox\/loveaffairsofbibliomaniac_1206_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-love-affairs-of-a-bibliomaniac-by-eugene-field\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:36:04","totaltimesecs":16564,"authors":[{"id":"614","first_name":"Eugene","last_name":"Field","dob":"1850","dod":"1895"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/loveaffairsofbibliomaniac_1206_librivox","sections":[{"id":"96549","section_number":"1","title":"MY FIRST LOVE","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"815","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96550","section_number":"2","title":"THE BIRTH OF A NEW PASSION","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"947","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96551","section_number":"3","title":"THE LUXURY OF READING IN BED","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"715","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7171","display_name":"April Gonzales"}]},{"id":"96552","section_number":"4","title":"THE MANIA OF COLLECTING SEIZES ME","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"880","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96553","section_number":"5","title":"BALDNESS AND INTELLECTUALITY","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"983","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7326","display_name":"Adam"}]},{"id":"96554","section_number":"6","title":"MY ROMANCE WITH FIAMMETTA","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"784","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96555","section_number":"7","title":"THE DELIGHTS OF FENDER-FISHING","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"902","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96556","section_number":"8","title":"BALLADS AND THEIR MAKERS","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"847","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96557","section_number":"9","title":"BOOKSELLERS AND PRINTERS, OLD AND NEW","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"985","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96558","section_number":"10","title":"WHEN FANCHONETTE BEWITCHED ME","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"835","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7150","display_name":"asterix"}]},{"id":"96559","section_number":"11","title":"DIAGNOSIS OF THE BACILLUS LIBRORUM","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"847","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"96560","section_number":"12","title":"THE PLEASURES OF EXTRA-ILLUSTRATION","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"808","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96561","section_number":"13","title":"ON THE ODORS WHICH MY BOOKS EXHALE","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"792","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5244","display_name":"Carolin Ksr"}]},{"id":"96562","section_number":"14","title":"ELZEVIRS AND DIVERS OTHER MATTERS","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"896","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96563","section_number":"15","title":"A BOOK THAT BRINGS SOLACE AND CHEER","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"910","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96564","section_number":"16","title":"THE MALADY CALLED CATALOGITIS","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"889","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"96565","section_number":"17","title":"THE NAPOLEONIC RENAISSANCE","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"723","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2909","display_name":"Petra"}]},{"id":"96566","section_number":"18","title":"MY WORKSHOP AND OTHERS","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"996","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"96567","section_number":"19","title":"OUR DEBT TO MONKISH MEN","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"925","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
