{"books":{"3":{"id":"9695","title":"Equation of Doom","description":"A world weary space pilot on the lam from earth for crimes unspecified; the most beautiful (earthly) tri-D woman in the universe who is determined to be the most powerful too; a planet of crafty and unscrupulous giant frogs intent on kicking out all aliens; and finally beings who live outside of time.   Mix them all together and some very interesting things happen.   Very interesting.  And disastrous.  But there's more!  Why did 3000 worlds across the galaxy suddenly blossom almost simultaneously with very similar life and intelligence?  Could there have been a common ancestor?  Well, give or take a million years, simultaneously.   The answer to all these questions is in this story.  Listen and find out what happens in Equation of Doom.
