{"books":{"10":{"id":"6065","title":"Molly Make-Believe (version 2)","description":"Carl Stanton is an invalid suffering from an unusual bout of rheumatism. His fianc\u00e9e is gone for the winter and though he begs her to write to help ease his boredom and pain she is stingy with her letters. She sends him what she calls a \"ridiculous circular\" which she states is very apropos of his sentimental passion for letters. In a sudden fit of mischief, malice and rheumatism, Carl decides to respond to the circular which results in bringing about the necessary distraction in a flurry of letters that do ease Carl\u2019s boredom and pain but also bring him something else that he never quite expected.
