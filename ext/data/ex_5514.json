{"books":{"46":{"id":"5514","title":"Snow-Burner","description":"The Snow-Burner is what the Native Americans called Reivers, and it was a rough and tumble life in the land where Reivers chose to live up to his name. The name was attributed to Reivers upon his proof after arriving in the north country because of his ability to defeat all perceived enemies in whatever means was necessary; whether by brute force and tough action, or by sheer cunning which he had gained living in the city in his earlier days. When assigned to oversee a group of foreigners in a work camp, he treated them with utter cruelty. When in search of an unknown source of gold, he found it necessary to combine his cunning with his forceful ways, proving his worthiness of the title given him.
