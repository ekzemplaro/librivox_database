{"books":{"65":{"id":"1679","title":"Phineas Finn the Irish Member","description":"<p>Phineas Finn is the sequel to \u201cCan you Forgive Her?\u201d and the second novel in Trollope\u2019s Palliser series. The eponymous hero is a young Irishman who becomes a member of the English parliament. Trollope aspired to become an M.P. himself, and he ably describes the workings of the English political scene. There is also a love interest, as the somewhat inconstant Phineas courts three different women: his Irish sweetheart, Mary Flood Jones; Lady Laura Standish, the daughter of a prominent Whig politician; and a lovely heiress, Violet Effingham. (Summary by Karen Merline)<\/p>\n<p>This is the second of Trollope\u2019s six \u201cPalliser\u201d novels.
