{"books":{"46":{"id":"4802","title":"Three Clerks","description":"The Three Clerks was Trollope\u2019s sixth novel and was written mostly in railway carriages, since his work for the Post Office still entailed a good deal of travelling; to make life easier for himself, Trollope had devised what he called his \u2018tablet\u2019, a square block which he rested upon his knees in such a way that he could write in complete comfort. The story is drawn from his memories of his work (as a clerk) at the GPO in St Martin-le-Grand, and it is considered the most autobiographical of Trollope\u2019s novels \u2013 a story of the differing fortunes of 3 young men working at \u201cWeights and Measures\u201d and their relationships with a family of 3 sisters.
