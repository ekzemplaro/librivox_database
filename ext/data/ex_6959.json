{"books":{"3":{"id":"6959","title":"Dancing Girls","description":"The Dancing Girls is just one of the 4 excellent short stories in this recording. All written by the master, Edna Ferber for magazines between 1910 and 1919 they naturally contain her unique mix of real people, sadness, joy and always humor. The lead Story, The Dancing Girls, is my favorite for the way she paints a picture of mid America small town society and how good people somehow (and sometimes) can find their way to each other. Other stories in this collection are Old Lady Mandel; Long Distance; and One Hundred Percent (Summary by Phil Chenevert) <\/p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/forum.librivox.org\/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=41482&p=774043#p774043","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"4","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6959","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/dancing_girls_pc_librivox\/dancing_girls_pc_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-dancing-girls-by-edna-ferber\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:44:27","totaltimesecs":9867,"authors":[{"id":"708","first_name":"Edna","last_name":"Ferber","dob":"1885","dod":"1968"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/dancing_girls_pc_librivox","sections":[{"id":"104747","section_number":"1","title":"1 - THE DANCING GIRLS","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2984","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"104748","section_number":"2","title":"2 - OLD LADY MANDLE","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3096","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"104749","section_number":"3","title":"3 - LONG DISTANCE","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"738","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"104750","section_number":"4","title":"4 - ONE HUNDRED PER CENT","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3049","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"}],"translators":[]}}}
