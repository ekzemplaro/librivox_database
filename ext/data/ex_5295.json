{"books":{"20":{"id":"5295","title":"Art of Money Getting","description":"Phineas Taylor Barnum (July 5, 1810 \u2013 April 7, 1891) was an American showman, businessman, and entertainer, remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes and for founding the circus that became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.<br \/>His successes may have made him the first \"show business\" millionaire. Although Barnum was also an author, publisher, philanthropist, and for some time a politician, he said of himself, \"I am a showman by profession...and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me,\" and his personal aims were \"to put money in his own coffers\".
