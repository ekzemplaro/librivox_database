{"books":{"19":{"id":"6630","title":"Luck Of Roaring Camp And Other Sketches","description":"Bret Harte (1836 \u2013 1902) was an American author and poet, best remembered for his accounts of pioneering life in California.... He moved to California in 1853, later working there in a number of capacities, including miner, teacher, messenger, and journalist. He spent part of his life in the northern California coastal town of Union (now known as Arcata), a settlement on Humboldt Bay that was established as a provisioning center for mining camps in the interior.... In 1868 he became editor of The Overland Monthly, another new literary magazine, but this one more in tune with the pioneering spirit of excitement in California. His story, \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\", appeared in the magazine's second issue, propelling Harte to nationwide fame. \u201cLuck...\u201d appeared in this first book along with other stories and sketches, especially \u201cThe Outcasts of Poker Flats,\u201d of which several movies were made.
