{"books":{"11":{"id":"5765","title":"Sixteenth-century Bristol","description":"Plague, piracy and payments to members of Parliament! The town of Bristol, England in the Sixteenth Century was a fascinating place, and John Latimer's book is a comprehensive guide to this period, describing royal visits from both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, as well as detailing contemporary pastimes such as wrestling competitions, bear-baiting and traveling players. He explains the sanitary arrangements, dreadful postal service and the difficulty of moving from the status of town to \"City\" among many other interesting topics.\r\nIt is made up of papers originally published in the Bristol Mercury in 1902-3 and is read by Bristolian, Elaine Webb.\r\nSummary by Cori Samuel and Elaine Webb","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/sixteenthcentury00latirich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1908","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5765","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox\/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/sixteenth-century-bristol-by-john-latimer\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:26:12","totaltimesecs":15972,"authors":[{"id":"2529","first_name":"John","last_name":"Latimer","dob":"1824","dod":"1904"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox","sections":[{"id":"72900","section_number":"1","title":"chapter 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1287","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72901","section_number":"2","title":"chapter 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1554","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72902","section_number":"3","title":"chapter 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"783","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72903","section_number":"4","title":"chapter 04","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1505","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72904","section_number":"5","title":"chapter 05","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1841","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72905","section_number":"6","title":"chapter 06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1598","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72906","section_number":"7","title":"chapter 07","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"791","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72907","section_number":"8","title":"chapter 08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"725","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72908","section_number":"9","title":"chapter 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1524","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72909","section_number":"10","title":"chapter 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1530","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72910","section_number":"11","title":"chapter 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1895","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]},{"id":"72911","section_number":"12","title":"chapter 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"939","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6292","display_name":"Elaine Webb"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
