{"books":{"18":{"id":"9258","title":"Storm","description":"<i>The Storm<\/i> (1704) holds a special place in the writings of Daniel Defoe.  Widely considered a founding document of modern journalism, <i>The Storm<\/i> narrates the calamitous events of November 1703 that are framed by the author in the first four chapters.  These are followed by verbatim eyewitness accounts, solicited from survivors through a newspaper advertisement that Defoe placed shortly after the hurricane struck.  Defoe is primarily known for his later fiction, loosely based on historical calamities, such as his <i>Journal of the Plague Year<\/i> (1722), and by fictionalized novels purporting to be first-person accounts, including <i>Robinson Crusoe<\/i> (1719) and <i>Moll Flanders <\/i>(1722).  It can be argued that <i>The Storm<\/i> was the journalistic crucible in which the master realist Defoe forged his later novelistic artistry, with its penchant for \"the telling detail.\"  In fact, his fiction novel <i>The Plague Year<\/i> remains a required reading for journalism students to this day, side-by-side with the non-fiction account of  <i>The Storm<\/i>. \u2013Denny Sayers","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/42234","language":"English","copyright_year":"1704","num_sections":"25","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9258","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Storm_(Daniel_Defoe)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-storm-by-daniel-defoe\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"895","first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Defoe","dob":"c.1660","dod":"1731"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"322100","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/storm_00_defoe_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1258","file_name":"storm_00_defoe_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"26","display_name":"Denny Sayers"}]},{"id":"322101","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/storm_01_defoe_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1478","file_name":"storm_01_defoe_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"26","display_name":"Denny Sayers"}]},{"id":"322102","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/storm_02_defoe_128k_edit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1337","file_name":"storm_02_defoe_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"26","display_name":"Denny Sayers"}]},{"id":"322103","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/storm_03_defoe_128k_edit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2622","file_name":"storm_03_defoe_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"26","display_name":"Denny Sayers"}]},{"id":"322105","section_number":"4","title":"Ch. 4 -
