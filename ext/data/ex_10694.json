{"books":{"12":{"id":"10694","title":"Lost Illusions: Two Poets","description":"Two Poets (1837) is the first book in Balzac\u2019s Lost Illusions trilogy, set in France in the post-Napoleonic period, when the new bourgeoisie was jostling for position alongside the old aristocracy. We meet Lucien Chardon, a young provincial who romantically aspires to be a poet and his friend David S\u00e9chard, who struggles to manage his father\u2019s printing shop and falls in love with Lucien\u2019s sister \u00c8ve. There emerges a picture of provincial life laced with greed and ambition. Balzac\u2018s novels are landmarks in the development of realism in literature, and Lost Illusions is one of his greatest works, included in the reference work, 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. The two other works in the trilogy are A Distinguished Provincial at Paris (1839) and \u00c8ve and David (1843). - Summary by Bruce Pirie<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu\/webbin\/gutbook\/lookup?num=1443","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10694","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Illusions_perdues","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"86","first_name":"Honor\u00e9 de","last_name":"Balzac","dob":"1799","dod":"1850"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"364150","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_01_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364151","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_02_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364152","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_03_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364153","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_04_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364154","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_05_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364155","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_06_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364156","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_07_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364157","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_08_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364158","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_09_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364159","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_10_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364160","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/twopoets_11_balzac_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364161","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]},{"id":"364162","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3699","display_name":"Bruce Pirie"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"20","name":"Literary Fiction"}],"translators":[{"id":"9758","first_name":"Ellen","last_name":"Marriage","dob":"1865","dod":"1946"}]}}}
