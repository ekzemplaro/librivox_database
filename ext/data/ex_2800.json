{"books":{"30":{"id":"2800","title":"Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning","description":"In considering the question of publishing these letters, which are all that ever passed between my father and mother, for after their marriage they were never separated, it seemed to me that my only alternatives were to allow them to be published or to destroy them. I might, indeed, have left the matter to the decision of others after my death, but that would be evading a responsibility which I feel that I ought to accept.\r\n\r\nEver since my mother's death these letters were kept by my father in a certain inlaid box, into which they exactly fitted, and where they have always rested, letter beside letter, each in its consecutive order and numbered on the envelope by his own hand.\r\n\r\nMy father destroyed all the rest of his correspondence, and not long before his death he said, referring to these letters: 'There they are, do with them as you please when I am dead and gone!'

book.)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/16182","language":"English","copyright_year":"1900","num_sections":"31","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2800","url_zip_file":null,"url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=17249","url_other":null,"totaltime":null,"totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"38","first_name":"Elizabeth
