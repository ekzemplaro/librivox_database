{"books":{"10":{"id":"8925","title":"Eight Pillars of Prosperity","description":"It is popularly supposed that a greater prosperity for individuals or nations can only come through a political and social reconstruction. This cannot be true apart from the practice of the moral virtues in the individuals that comprise a nation. Better laws and social conditions will always follow a higher realization of morality among the individuals of a community, but no legal enactment can give prosperity to, nay it cannot prevent the ruin of, a man or a nation that has become lax and decadent in the pursuit and practice of virtue.\n\nThe moral virtues are the foundation and support of prosperity as they are the soul of greatness. They endure for ever, and all the works of man which endure are built upon them. Without them there is neither strength, stability, nor substantial reality, but only ephemeral dreams. To find moral principles is to have found prosperity, greatness, truth, and is therefore to be strong, valiant, joyful and free.  - Summary by James Allen","url_text_source":"http:\/\/james-allen.in1woord.nl\/?text=eight-pillars-of-prosperity","language":"English","copyright_year":"1911","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8925","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/eightpillarsofprosperity_1411_librivox\/eightpillarsofprosperity_1411_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/eight-pillars-of-prosperity-by-james-allen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:56:09","totaltimesecs":14169,"authors":[{"id":"1323","first_name":"James","last_name":"Allen","dob":"1864","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/eightpillarsofprosperity_1411_librivox","sections":[{"id":"312786","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_00_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"110","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_00_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312787","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1: Eight Pillars","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_01_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1315","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_01_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312788","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2: First Pillar \u2013 Energy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_02_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1558","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_02_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312789","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3: Second Pillar \u2013 Economy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_03_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1899","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_03_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312790","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4: Third Pillar \u2013 Integrity","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_04_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1314","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_04_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312791","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5: Fourth Pillar \u2013 System","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_05_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1384","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_05_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312792","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6: Fifth Pillar \u2013 Sympathy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_06_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1492","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_06_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312793","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7: Sixth Pillar \u2013 Sincerity","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_07_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1305","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_07_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312794","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8: Seventh Pillar \u2013 Impartiality","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_08_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1468","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_08_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312795","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9: Eighth Pillar \u2013 Self-reliance","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_09_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1297","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_09_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"312796","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10: The Temple of Prosperity","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/eightpillarsofprosperity_10_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1027","file_name":"eightpillarsofprosperity_10_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
