{"books":{"67":{"id":"10881","title":"Upward Path: A Reader For Colored Children","description":"From the preface of the book: \"To the present time, there has been no collection of stories and poems by Negro writers, which colored children could read with interest and pleasure and in which they could find a mirror of the traditions and aspirations of their race. Realizing this lack, Myron T. Pritchard, Principal of the Everett School, Boston, and Mary White Ovington, Chairman of the Board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, have brought together poems, stories, sketches and addresses which bear eloquent testimony to the richness of the literary product of our Negro writers. It is the hope that this little book will find a large welcome in all sections of the country and will bring good cheer and encouragement to the young readers who have so largely the fortunes of their race in their own hands.\" ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/31456","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"68","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10881","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"18","first_name":"","last_name":"Various","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"370563","section_number":"0","title":"Forword and Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/upwardpath_00_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9737","display_name":"Diana Schmidt"}]},{"id":"370564","section_number":"1","title":"The Boy and the Bayonet","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/upwardpath_01_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10801","display_name":"Jim Locke"}]},{"id":"370565","section_number":"2","title":"The Beginnings of a Mississippi School","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/upwardpath_02_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10891","display_name":"Matthew Datcher"}]},{"id":"370566","section_number":"3","title":"Up From Slavery: The Struggle for an Education","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/upwardpath_03_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10801","display_name":"Jim Locke"}]},{"id":"370567","section_number":"4","title":"Booker T.
