{"books":{"7":{"id":"4087","title":"William Tell Told Again","description":"<p>This is the classic story of William Tell - Swiss patriot and great apple-shooter - as seen through the eyes of English humorist P.G. Wodehouse.\r\nNo Swiss were (permanently) injured in the telling of this story; however, results differed for Austrian tyrants.\r\n\r\nThe original volume also included a humorous poem encapsulating the whole Tell legend, written by John W. Houghton to accompany the sixteen color illustrations. For this audiobook, the stanzas have been collected and read as a single poem. (Introduction by Mark F. Smith)\r\n<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/7298","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4087","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/william_tell_1003_librivox\/william_tell_1003_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Tell_Told_Again","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/william-tell-told-again-by-p-g-wodehouse\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:44:01","totaltimesecs":6241,"authors":[{"id":"420","first_name":"P.
