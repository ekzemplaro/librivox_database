{"books":{"16":{"id":"4210","title":"God of All Comfort","description":"This book is written to Christians who profess to believe the Bible as God's revelation, but whose \"lives are filled with discomfort and unrest.\" Smith aims to show that the Bible's claim that God is the \"the God of all comfort\" is not an over-advertisement or misunderstanding, but that it is possible to avail ourselves of the doubts and heavy anxieties that plague so many Christians. <br\/><br\/>\n\nBy explaining God's part and man's part, Smith aims to show her readers that it is possible to overcome feelings of defeat and despair and find rest and peace in Christ. Abundant life and genuine enduring joy are available to all believers - even you. Deep and lasting peace, beyond all Earthly circumstances, is possible. \n\n(Introduction by Rachel Craig)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.ccel.org\/ccel\/smith_hw\/comfort.toc.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4210","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/god_comfort_1110_librivox\/god_comfort_1110_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-god-of-all-comfort-by-hannah-whitall-smith\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:04:40","totaltimesecs":29080,"authors":[{"id":"2385","first_name":"Hannah Whitall","last_name":"Smith","dob":"1832","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/god_comfort_1110_librivox","sections":[{"id":"32235","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Why this book has been written","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1155","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6016","display_name":"Karen Fifer"}]},{"id":"32236","section_number":"2","title":"02 - What is his name?","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1719","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5809","display_name":"kattekliek"}]},{"id":"32237","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The God of all comfort","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1957","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5868","display_name":"alwpoe"}]},{"id":"32238","section_number":"4","title":"04 - The Lord our Shepherd","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2806","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6032","display_name":"Beverly Scott"}]},{"id":"32239","section_number":"5","title":"05 - He spake to them of the father","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1714","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6084","display_name":"Amallen"}]},{"id":"32240","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Jehovah","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1862","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5809","display_name":"kattekliek"}]},{"id":"32241","section_number":"7","title":"07 - 'The Lord is good'","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1658","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4295","display_name":"Slawek"}]},{"id":"32242","section_number":"8","title":"08 - The Lord our dwelling place","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1597","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6580","display_name":"Stephanie Schneider"}]},{"id":"32243","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Much more versus much less","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1838","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6182","display_name":"Michael Feldbush"}]},{"id":"32244","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Self-examination","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1626","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5949","display_name":"debolee"}]},{"id":"32245","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Things that cannot be shaken","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1489","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6591","display_name":"Rai\u00f1a"}]},{"id":"32246","section_number":"12","title":"12 - A word to the wavering ones","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1498","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6173","display_name":"Carol Box"}]},{"id":"32247","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Discouragement","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1584","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6568","display_name":"Heather Hamtil"}]},{"id":"32248","section_number":"14","title":"14 - The shout of faith","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1476","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6789","display_name":"Carol Kutcher"}]},{"id":"32249","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Thanksgiving versus complaining","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1822","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5949","display_name":"debolee"}]},{"id":"32250","section_number":"16","title":"16 - Conformed to the image of Christ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1748","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6169","display_name":"Daisy"}]},{"id":"32251","section_number":"17","title":"17 - God is enough","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1531","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6173","display_name":"Carol Box"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"},{"id":"130","name":"Christianity - Other"}],"translators":[]}}}
