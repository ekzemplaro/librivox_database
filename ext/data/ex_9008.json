{"books":{"23":{"id":"9008","title":"Patience (Bunthorne's Bride)","description":"A comic operetta which is a satire on the themes of fashion and pretension and hero-worship. Bunthorne is a poet who pretends to be highly \"idealised\" in order to impress the ladies. They all worship him, except for Patience, the dairy maid, who is the only one he loves. However, his grand plan goes awry with the arrival of Grosvenor who is more idealised and more poetical then he is. The ladies all flock after Grosvenor instead, until Bunthorne curses him with poor fashion sense and stoutness! But will the curse bring Bunthorne his Patience? - Summary by Beth Thomas","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/patienceorbuntho00gilbuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1911","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9008","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Patience_(opera)","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"334","first_name":"W.
