{"books":{"4":{"id":"206","title":"Oku no Hosomichi","description":"<p>Oku no Hosomichi (meaning Narrow Road to Oku [the Deep North]) is a major work by Matsuo Bash\u014d.<br><br>\n\nOku no Hosomichi was written based on a journey taken by Bash\u014d in the late spring of 1689. He and his traveling companion Sora departed from Edo (modern-day Tokyo) for the northerly interior region known as Oku, propelled mostly by a desire to see the places about which the old poets wrote. Travel in those days was, of course, very dangerous to one\u2019s health, but Bash\u014d was committed to a kind of poetic ideal of wandering. He travelled for about 156 days all together, covering thousands of miles mostly on foot. Of all of Bash\u014d\u2019s works, Oku no Hosomichi is best known.\n(Summary from Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/etext.lib.virginia.edu\/japanese\/basho\/index.html","language":"Japanese","copyright_year":"1694","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/206","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/oku_no_hosomichi_librivox\/oku_no_hosomichi_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/\u304a\u304f\u306e\u307b\u305d\u9053","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/oku-no-hosomichi-by-matsuo-basho\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:08:21","totaltimesecs":4101,"authors":[{"id":"3181","first_name":"Matsuo","last_name":"Bash\u014d","dob":"1644","dod":"1694"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/oku_no_hosomichi_librivox","sections":[{"id":"191","section_number":"1","title":"Chapters 01 to 09","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"740","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"368","display_name":"kaseumin"}]},{"id":"192","section_number":"2","title":"Chapters 10 to 18","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"669","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"368","display_name":"kaseumin"}]},{"id":"193","section_number":"3","title":"Chapters 19 to 27","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"987","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"368","display_name":"kaseumin"}]},{"id":"194","section_number":"4","title":"Chapters 28 to 36","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"940","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"368","display_name":"kaseumin"}]},{"id":"195","section_number":"5","title":"Chapters 37 to 45","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"765","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"368","display_name":"kaseumin"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"}],"translators":[]}}}
