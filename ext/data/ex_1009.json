{"books":{"19":{"id":"1009","title":"Selected Poems of John Clare, Volume 1","description":"John Clare (1793 - 1864) was a farm labourer in the village of Helpstone, Northamptonshire, who became arguably England\u2019s greatest nature poet. He rose to fame when his \u2018Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery\u2019 was published in 1820. His language preserves many local dialect words in a mixture of classical forms and heart-felt love of country life and nature. The poems in this collection are from his early career, and are largely free of pointers to his later mental illness.
