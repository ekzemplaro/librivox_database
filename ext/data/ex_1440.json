{"books":{"13":{"id":"1440","title":"Memoir of Jane Austen","description":"\"The Memoir of my Aunt, Jane Austen, has been received with more favour than I had ventured to expect.  The notices taken of it in the periodical press, as well as letters addressed to me by many with whom I am not personally acquainted, show that an unabated interest is still taken in every particular that can be told about her.  I am thus encouraged not only to offer a Second Edition of the Memoir, but also to enlarge it with some additional matter which I might have scrupled to intrude on the public if they had not thus seemed to call for it.  In the present Edition, the narrative is somewhat enlarged, and a few more letters are added; with a short specimen of her childish stories.  The cancelled chapter of \u2018Persuasion\u2019 is given, in compliance with wishes both publicly and privately expressed.  A fragment of a story entitled \u2018The Watsons\u2019 is printed; p. iii and extracts are given from a novel which she had begun a few months before her death; but the chief addition is a short tale never before published, called \u2018Lady Susan.\u2019 {0a}  I regret that the little which I have been able to add could not appear in my First Edition; as much of it was either unknown to me, or not at my command, when I first published; and I hope that I may claim some indulgent allowance for the difficulty of recovering little facts and feelings which had been merged half a century deep in oblivion.\" - James Edward Austen-Leigh in the Preface to <i>Memoir of Jane Austen<\/i>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/17797","language":"English","copyright_year":"1870","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1440","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/memoir_jane_austen_0805_librivox\/memoir_jane_austen_0805_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/memoir-of-jane-austen-by-james-austen-leigh\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:59:37","totaltimesecs":17977,"authors":[{"id":"4521","first_name":" James Edward","last_name":"Austen-Leigh","dob":"1798","dod":"1874"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/memoir_jane_austen_0805_librivox","sections":[{"id":"145014","section_number":"1","title":"Preface and Chapter 1: Introductory Remarks--Birth of Jane Austen--Her Family","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1417","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1750","display_name":"Lorie Heinrichs"}]},{"id":"145015","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2: Description of Steventon--Life at Steventon--Changes of Habits and Customs in the last Century","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1987","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2391","display_name":"treefingers"}]},{"id":"145016","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3: Early Compositions--Friends at Ashe--A very Old Letter--Lines on the Death of Mrs. Lefroy--Observations on Jane Austen's Letter-writing--Letters","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2197","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1401","display_name":"Sibella Denton"}]},{"id":"145017","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4: Removal from Steventon--Residence at Bath and at Southampton--Settling at Chawton","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1406","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1401","display_name":"Sibella Denton"}]},{"id":"145018","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5: Description of Jane Austen's person, character, and tastes","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1129","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1401","display_name":"Sibella Denton"}]},{"id":"145019","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6: Habits of Composition resumed after a long interval--First publication--The interest taken by the Author in the success of her Works","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1099","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2237","display_name":"Chloey Winters"}]},{"id":"145020","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7: Seclusion from the literary world--Notice from the Prince Regent--Correspondence with Mr. Clarke--Suggestions to alter her style of writing","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1905","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2374","display_name":"M.C.Y."}]},{"id":"145021","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8: Slow growth of her fame--Ill success of first attempts at publication--Two Reviews of her works contrasted","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"786","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"145022","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9: Opinions expressed by eminent persons--Opinions of others of less eminence--Opinion of American readers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"819","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"77","display_name":"JemmaBlythe"}]},{"id":"145023","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10: Observations on the Novels","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"543","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1401","display_name":"Sibella Denton"}]},{"id":"145024","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11: Declining health of Jane Austen--Elasticity of her spirits--Her resignation and humility--Her death","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1628","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1132","display_name":"Giles Baker"}]},{"id":"145025","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12: The cancelled Chapter of 'Persuasion'","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1391","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"145026","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13: The last work","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1240","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1401","display_name":"Sibella Denton"}]},{"id":"145027","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 14: Postscript","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"430","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
