{"books":{"15":{"id":"7950","title":"Modern Russian Poetry: An Anthology","description":"This volume...aims to present the lyrical poetry of Russian for the last hundred years by a selection of poems translated by the editors...The principle of selection was, so far as might be, aesthetic. Poems were chosen less for their representative quality than for their immediate worth, and of course, their ability to stand the test of translation. Represented authors are: Alexander Pushkin, Yevgeny Baratynsky, Alexey Koltzov, Mikhail Lermontov, Fyodor Tyuchev, Nikolai Nerasov, Alexy K. Tolstoy, Apollon Maikov, Afanasy Shenshin-Foeth, Yakov Polonsky, Vladimir Solovyov, N. Minsky, Dmitry Merezhanovsky, Fyodor Sologub, Zinaida Hippius, Konstantin Balmont, Valery Brusov, Ivan Bunin, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Yuris Balthrushaitis, Maximillian Voloshin, Mikhail Kuzmin, Georgy Chulkov, Alexander Blok, Andrey Bely, Vasily Bashkin, Sergey Gorodetzky, Anna Akhmatova, Igor Severyanin, Nikolai Kluyev, Lubov Stolitza, Sergei Yesenin, Z. Shishova, Piotr Oreshin, and Anatoly Marienhov.
