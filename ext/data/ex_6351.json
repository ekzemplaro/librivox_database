{"books":{"23":{"id":"6351","title":"Lyrical Ballads (1798)","description":"<br \/><em>Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems<\/em> is a collection of poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first published in 1798 and generally considered to have marked the beginning of the English Romantic movement in literature. The immediate effect on critics was modest, but it became and remains a landmark, changing the course of English literature and poetry. Most of the poems in the 1798 edition were written by Wordsworth, with Coleridge contributing only four poems to the collection, including one of his most famous works, <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner<\/em>. (Additionally, though only the two writers are credited for the works, William's sister Dorothy Wordsworth's diary which held powerful descriptions of everyday surroundings influenced William's poetry immensely.)
