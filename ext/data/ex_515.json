{"books":[{"id":"515","title":"Ballad of Reading Gaol, (version 2)","description":"<p>In 1895, Oscar Wilde was sentenced to 2 years of hard labor for acts of \u2018gross indecency\u2019. During his time at Reading Gaol, he witnessed a rare hanging, and in the three years between his release and his untimely death in 1900, was inspired to write the following poem, a meditation on the death penalty and the importance of forgiveness, even for (and especially for) something as heinous as murdering one\u2019s spouse; for even the murderer, Wilde argues, is human and suffers more so for being the cause of his own pain, for \u2018having killed the thing he loved\u2019; for everyone is the cause of someone else\u2019s suffering and suffers at the hands of another. It is this that Jesus Christ could see; he could continue to see the beauty of our humanity, despite all that we may do to each other, and encouraged us to love each other just the same.<\/p><p> \u201cThe Ballad of Reading Gaol\u201d was published in 1898 and would gain Wilde greater recognition as a poet (in addition to being a great playwright); although his only other volume of poetry, one of his earliest works that he\u2019d published, was also well-received. Sadly, \u2018The Ballad\u2019 would be his last.<\/p>\n<p>(Summary by Linda Leu).<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/301","language":"English","copyright_year":"1897","num_sections":"1","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/515","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ballad_of_reading_gaol_ll_librivox\/ballad_of_reading_gaol_ll_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-ballad-of-reading-gaol-by-oscar-wilde-ll\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:42:51","totaltimesecs":2571,"authors":[{"id":"114","first_name":"Oscar","last_name":"Wilde","dob":"1854","dod":"1900"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/ballad_of_reading_gaol_ll_librivox","sections":[{"id":"128415","section_number":"1","title":"The Ballad of Reading Gaol","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2571","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"102","display_name":"Linda Leu"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}]}
