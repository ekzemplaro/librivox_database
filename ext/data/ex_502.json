{"books":{"99":{"id":"502","title":"Reviews","description":"<p>Wilde\u2019s literary reputation has survived so much that I think it proof against any exhumation of articles which he or his admirers would have preferred to forget.  As a matter of fact, I believe this volume will prove of unusual interest; some of the reviews are curiously prophetic; some are, of course, biassed by prejudice hostile or friendly; others are conceived in the author\u2019s wittiest and happiest vein; only a few are colourless.  And if, according to Lord Beaconsfield, the verdict of a continental nation may be regarded as that of posterity, Wilde is a much greater force in our literature than even friendly contemporaries ever supposed he would become.<\/p>\n\n<p>It should be remembered, however, that at the time when most of these reviews were written Wilde had published scarcely any of the works by which his name has become famous in Europe, though the protagonist of the \u00e6sthetic movement was a well-known figure in Paris and London.
