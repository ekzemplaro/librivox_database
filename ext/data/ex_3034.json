{"books":{"33":{"id":"3034","title":"Free Air","description":"This road trip novel is set in the early twentieth century and follows the experiences of an aristocratic New Englander and her father as they travel by automobile from Minneapolis to Seattle. She is wooed and won by a noble but simple commoner she meets along the way. Lewis is at his usual wryly humorous self, poking fun at the upper class and treating the common people only slightly better.

Hanover.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/26732","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"34","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3034","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/free_air_hh_librivox\/free_air_hh_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Free_Air","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/free-air-by-sinclair-lewis\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:22:00","totaltimesecs":30120,"authors":[{"id":"98","first_name":"Sinclair","last_name":"Lewis","dob":"1885","dod":"1951"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/free_air_hh_librivox","sections":[{"id":"178098","section_number":"1","title":"Miss
