{"books":{"8":{"id":"8122","title":"Tenting To-Night; A Chronicle Of Sport And Adventure In Glacier Park And The Cascade Mountains","description":"This is the second of two travelogues published by Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1958).  Both deal with Glacier National Park, and this book also deals with the Cascade Mountains (The other is entitled Through Glacier Park).  Rinehart wrote hundreds of short stories, poems, travelogues and articles, though she is most famous for her mystery stories.  The region that became Glacier National Park was first inhabited by Native Americans and upon the arrival of European explorers, was dominated by the Blackfeet in the east and the Flathead in the western regions. - Summary by wikipedia and david wales<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/19475","language":"English","copyright_year":"1918","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8122","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/tentingtonight_1308_librivox\/tentingtonight_1308_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"na","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/tenting-to-night-a-chronicle-of-sport-and-adventure-in-glacier-park-and-the-cascade-mountains-by-mary-roberts-rinehart\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:46:26","totaltimesecs":13586,"authors":[{"id":"286","first_name":"Mary Roberts","last_name":"Rinehart","dob":"1876","dod":"1958"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/tentingtonight_1308_librivox","sections":[{"id":"291790","section_number":"1","title":"The Trail and The Big Adventure","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_01_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1714","file_name":"tentingtonight_01_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291791","section_number":"2","title":"Bridge Creek To Bowman Lake and A Fisherman's Paradise","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_02_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1886","file_name":"tentingtonight_02_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291792","section_number":"3","title":"To Kintla Lake and Running The Rapids Of the Flathead","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_03_rineheart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1470","file_name":"tentingtonight_03_rineheart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291793","section_number":"4","title":"The Second Day On The Flathead and Through The Flathead Canon","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_04_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1290","file_name":"tentingtonight_04_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291794","section_number":"5","title":"The Round-Up At Kalispell and Off For Cascade Pass","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_05_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1541","file_name":"tentingtonight_05_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291795","section_number":"6","title":"Lake Chelan To Lyman Lake","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_06_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1336","file_name":"tentingtonight_06_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291796","section_number":"7","title":"Cloudy Pass And The Agnes Creek Valley and Canon Fishing And A Telegram","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_07_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1537","file_name":"tentingtonight_07_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291797","section_number":"8","title":"Doing The Impossible and Doubtful Lake","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_08_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1209","file_name":"tentingtonight_08_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"291798","section_number":"9","title":"Over Cascade Pass and Out To Civilization","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/tentingtonight_09_rinehart_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1603","file_name":"tentingtonight_09_rinehart_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"}],"translators":[]}}}
