{"books":{"12":{"id":"5690","title":"History of England, from the Accession of James II - (Volume 4, Chapter 18)","description":"This is volume 4 chapter 18 of a series of books written by the Baron Macaulay (1800-1859) in the 19th century. It starts with a brief resume of the history of England up until the Stuart kings and then starts to delve into a little more detail. Macaulay is primarily fascinated by ending of any claim to divine right of kings and the growing role of Parliament in the governing of the country. He sees the accession of William and Mary (Dutch, Protestant royalty) to the British throne as a key moment in the history of the British Isles. This is a book delightful for the literary gifts of the author and intriguing for his view of 18th century English and world politics.\n(Jim Mowatt)<\/p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2613","language":"English","copyright_year":"1870","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5690","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/macaulay_vol4_chap18_1108_librivox\/macaulay_vol4_chap18_1108_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/history-of-england-from-the-accession-of-james-ii-volume-4-chapter-18-by-thomas-babington-macaulay\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:19:58","totaltimesecs":15598,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/macaulay_vol4_chap18_1108_librivox","sections":[{"id":"71293","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1319","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6395","display_name":"Richard Carpenter"}]},{"id":"71294","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"983","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"71295","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1058","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"71296","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 04","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1494","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"71297","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 05","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1312","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6512","display_name":"mcgovern1934"}]},{"id":"71298","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1590","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"71299","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 07","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1023","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"71300","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"982","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"71301","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1107","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"71302","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1065","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6006","display_name":"Stephanie Lee"}]},{"id":"71303","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1195","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6482","display_name":"Delmar H Dolbier"}]},{"id":"71304","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1057","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6482","display_name":"Delmar H Dolbier"}]},{"id":"71305","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter XVIII, Section 13","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1413","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6482","display_name":"Delmar H Dolbier"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "},{"id":"99","name":"Political Science"}],"translators":[]}}}
