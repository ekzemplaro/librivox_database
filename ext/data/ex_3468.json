{"books":{"35":{"id":"3468","title":"Mr. Wicker's Window","description":"When twelve-year-old Chris entered Mr. Wicker's shop to inquire about a job for his friend, something about old Mr. Wicker forced him to take the job himself. Chris found himself the pupil of Mr. Wicker, not the old man he first saw, but a powerful man in his forties--a magician. Chris learned how to turn himself into a fish, a bird, a fly, and with a magic rope he learned to make a boat or even an elephant.\r\n\r\nChris had been chosen to sail to China on a mysterious mission. Long before he sailed, Chris met the enemies who would try and stop him--evil Claggett Chew, the dandy Osterbridge Hawsey, the treacherous old beggar Simon Gosler. With a Nubian boy Chris brought to life with magic, he set out on his hazardous voyage.(Summary by Saturday Review of
