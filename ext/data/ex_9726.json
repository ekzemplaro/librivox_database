{"books":{"2":{"id":"9726","title":"Kitchen Cat and Other Stories","description":"These are three stories that will delight your heart and soul.   The little girl Ruth in the first story is very privileged young lady with everything she could wish for except,of course, for companionship. Her mother has passed away and her father is a very busy lawyer who barely notices she is there.  But then Ruth finds a scruffy, skinny and mostly ugly cat; the cat who lives in the kitchen and cellars,hence The Kitchen Cat.  Her attempts to befriend this stray despite insurmountable obstsacles make this story a really heart warming tale.   She does eventually find the best kind of companionship but I won't tell you with who or when.   Sarah's Sunday Out is the tale of a pampered little dog who wants to see the world and finally The Toad in the Hole is the tale of a  somewhat selfish little girl and her lesson in seeing things from anothers' point of view.   All are bitter sweet and all are delightful. You will be glad you listened to them.  I know I'm glad I read them.
