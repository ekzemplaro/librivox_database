This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for February 26, 2012.<br><br>Alfred Joyce Kilmer was an American journalist, poet, literary critic, lecturer, and editor. Though a prolific poet whose works celebrated the common beauty of the natural world as well as his religious faith, Kilmer is remembered most for a short poem titled \"Trees\" (1913), which was published in the collection Trees and Other Poems in 1914.<br><br>At the time of his deployment to Europe during World War I (1914\u20131918), Kilmer was considered the leading American Catholic poet and lecturer of his generation, whom critics often compared to British contemporaries G. K. Chesterton (1874\u20131936) and Hilaire Belloc (1870\u20131953). A sergeant in the 165th U.S. Infantry Regiment (better known as 'The Fighting 69th), Kilmer was killed at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31.
