{"books":{"16":{"id":"8804","title":"Inventions Of The Great War","description":"\u201c\u2026 this war was not one of mere destruction. It set men to thinking as they had never thought before. It intensified their inventive faculties, and as a result, the world is richer in many ways. Lessons of thrift and economy have been taught us. Manufacturers have learned the value of standardization. The business man has gained an appreciation of scientific research. The whole story is too big to be contained within the covers of a single book, but I have selected the more important and interesting inventions and have endeavored to describe them in simple language for the benefit of the reader who is not technically trained.\u201d Bond was the sometime editor of Scientific American magazine.\n( Book Preface, David Wales)
