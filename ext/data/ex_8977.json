{"books":{"4":{"id":"8977","title":"Old Christmas: From the Sketch Book of Washington Irving","description":"Washington Irving's Old Christmas tells of an American's travels through England during the Christmas season.  Through a chance meeting with an old friend he is able to experience Christmas in a stately manor house.  Through his eyes as a houseguest he glimpses the uniquely British customs and celebrations of Christmas as it would have been experienced during the Middle Ages, rather than in the early 19th century.  - Summary by Greg Giordano<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/20656","language":"English","copyright_year":"1886","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8977","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/old_christmas_version_2_gg_1407_librivox\/old_christmas_version_2_gg_1407_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/old-christmas-from-the-sketch-book-of-washington-irving-by-washington-irving\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:59:52","totaltimesecs":7192,"authors":[{"id":"1743","first_name":"Washington","last_name":"Irving","dob":"1783","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/old_christmas_version_2_gg_1407_librivox","sections":[{"id":"314667","section_number":"1","title":"Christmas","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/oldchristmasversion2_01_irving_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"942","file_name":"oldchristmasversion2_01_irving_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"314668","section_number":"2","title":"The Stage Coach","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/oldchristmasversion2_02_irving_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1015","file_name":"oldchristmasversion2_02_irving_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"314669","section_number":"3","title":"Christmas Eve","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/oldchristmasversion2_03_irving_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1551","file_name":"oldchristmasversion2_03_irving_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"314670","section_number":"4","title":"Christmas Day","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/oldchristmasversion2_04_irving_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1786","file_name":"oldchristmasversion2_04_irving_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"314671","section_number":"5","title":"The Christmas Dinner","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/oldchristmasversion2_05_irving_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1898","file_name":"oldchristmasversion2_05_irving_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"6","name":"Culture & Heritage"},{"id":"14","name":"Fictional Biographies & Memoirs"},{"id":"18","name":"Historical Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
