{"books":{"8":{"id":"10073","title":"Nature (version 2)","description":"First published anonymously in 1836, Nature marks the beginning both of Emerson\u2019s literary career and the Transcendentalist movement. Asking why his generation \u201cshould not also enjoy an original relation to the universe,\u201d Emerson argues that \u201cMan is a god in ruins\u201d who might yet be redeemed by the renewal of harmony with nature. Encompassing themes that would preoccupy him for years to come, including the repressive force of social routine, the divinity of nature, and the creative potential of the individual, Nature reflected recent developments in European philosophy and literature even as it pushed American artists to break new ground. The book\u2019s initial reception was mixed, but it influenced members of Emerson\u2019s circle, including such luminaries as Henry David Thoreau and Margaret Fuller, and it would go on to inspire the work of writers ranging from Walt Whitman and Friedrich Nietzsche to Robert Frost and Ralph Ellison. - Summary by Jesse Zuba<\/p>","url_text_source":"www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/29433","language":"English","copyright_year":"1849","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10073","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/nature_version_2_1507_librivox\/nature_version_2_1507_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nature_(essay)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/nature-version-2-by-ralph-waldo-emerson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:47:59","totaltimesecs":6479,"authors":[{"id":"1159","first_name":"Ralph Waldo","last_name":"Emerson","dob":"1803","dod":"1882"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/nature_version_2_1507_librivox","sections":[{"id":"346050","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_00_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"271","file_name":"nature_00_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346051","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I - Nature","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_01_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"406","file_name":"nature_01_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346052","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II - Commodity","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_02_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"231","file_name":"nature_02_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346053","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III - Beauty","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_03_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"865","file_name":"nature_03_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346054","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV - Language","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_04_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"984","file_name":"nature_04_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346055","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter V - Discipline","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_05_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1022","file_name":"nature_05_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346056","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter VI - Idealism","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_06_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1224","file_name":"nature_06_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346057","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter VII - Spirit","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_07_spirit_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"442","file_name":"nature_07_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]},{"id":"346058","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter VIII - Prospects","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/nature_08_emerson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1034","file_name":"nature_08_emerson_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10104","display_name":"Jesse Zuba"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"120","name":"Essays"}],"translators":[]}}}
