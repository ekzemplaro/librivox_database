{"books":{"5":{"id":"4635","title":"American Cookery","description":"<i>American Cookery<\/i>, by Amelia Simmons, was the first known cookbook written by an American, published in 1796. Until this time, the cookbooks printed and used in what became the United States were British cookbooks, so the importance of this book is obvious to American culinary history, and more generally, to the history of America. The full title of this book was: <i>American Cookery, or the art of dressing viands, fish, poultry, and vegetables, and the best modes of making pastes, puffs, pies, tarts, puddings, custards, and preserves, and all kinds of cakes, from the imperial plum to plain cake: Adapted to this country, and all grades of life.<\/i> (Description from Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/12815","language":"English","copyright_year":"1796","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4635","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/american_cookery_1105_librivox\/american_cookery_1105_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Cookery","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/american-cookery-by-amelia-simmons\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:37:14","totaltimesecs":5834,"authors":[{"id":"2024","first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"Simmons","dob":"1700","dod":"1800"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/american_cookery_1105_librivox","sections":[{"id":"44061","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Preface -- Directions for Catering, or the procuring the best Viands, Fish, &c.","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"836","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"44062","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Roots and Vegetables -- Beans -- Fruits","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"856","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"44063","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Receipts -- [Meats] -- [Pies]","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1016","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"44064","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Puddings -- Custards -- Tarts-- Syllabubs","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1063","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"44065","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Cake","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"826","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"44066","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Preserves -- [Boiling] -- Errata","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1237","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"}],"translators":[]}}}
