{"books":{"12":{"id":"7222","title":"Master's Indwelling","description":" In all the writings of the late nineteenth century minister and writer Andrew Murray, we see his passion for reality in the lives of Christian believers. In this series of addresses he explains how, in various areas of the spiritual life, one may grow in God and experience more of his power. In particular he shows the importance of Christ truly being given his rightful place in the believer\u2019s life. There are chapters on: carnal Christians, the self life, waiting on God, entrance into rest, the kingdom first, Christ our life, Christ's humility our salvation, complete surrender, being dead with Christ, joy in the Holy Ghost, the triumph of faith, the source of power in prayer, and God being all in all. Although written well over a century ago, this book is still relevant and amazingly up to date!
