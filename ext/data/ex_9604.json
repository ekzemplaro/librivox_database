{"books":{"10":{"id":"9604","title":"Saint Benedict","description":"Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480 \u2013 543 or 547) is honoured by the Catholic Church as the patron saint of Europe and students. Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at Subiaco, Italy (about 40 miles (64 km) to the east of Rome), before moving to Monte Cassino in the mountains of southern Italy. One of his most well known achievement is his \"Rule of Saint Benedict\", containing precepts for his monks. He is often called the founder of western monasticism.
