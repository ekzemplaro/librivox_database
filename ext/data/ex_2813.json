{"books":{"33":{"id":"2813","title":"War and Peace, Book 11: 1812","description":"War and Peace (Russian: \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440, Voyna i mir; in original orthography: \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u044a, Voyna i mir\u201d) is an epic novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from 1865 to 1869 in Russki Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one of Tolstoy\u2019s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world\u2019s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy\u2019s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.
