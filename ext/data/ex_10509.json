{"books":{"11":{"id":"10509","title":"Alice in Wonderland, Retold in Words of One Syllable","description":"The well known and delightful tale of Alice in Wonderland but retold in simpler language.  All the characters are there, even the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter.      Note that even though the title says 'words of one syllable', there are quite a few two and even multiple syllable words which the author divides into smaller bites by using dashes.  Don't let this bother you.  The book is well written and would be an excellent choice for new readers or those for whom English is not their first language.
