{"books":{"21":{"id":"5488","title":"Bible (KJV) 23: Isaiah","description":"<i>The Book of Isaiah<\/i> is one of the Major Prophets in the Old Testament. Jews and Christians consider the Book of Isaiah a part of their Biblical canon. Christians believe that Isaiah prophesied the virgin birth of Jesus Christ (Isaiah 7:14, KJV): \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\" Many of the New Testament teachings of Jesus refer to the book of Isaiah.<br\/><br\/>\nGregory of Nyssa (c. 335\u2013395), believes that the Prophet Esaias (Isaiah) \"knew more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel.\" Jerome (c. 342\u2013420) also lauds the Prophet Esias, saying, \"He was more of an Evangelist than a Prophet, because he described all of the Mysteries of the Church of Christ so vividly that you would assume he was not prophesying about the future, but rather was composing a history of past events.\" (Introduction from Wikipedia) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8023","language":"English","copyright_year":"1611","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5488","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/isaiah_kjv_1107_librivox\/isaiah_kjv_1107_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Book_of_Isaiah","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/isaiah-king-james-version\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:28:25","totaltimesecs":16105,"authors":[{"id":"950","first_name":"","last_name":"King James Version (KJV)","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/isaiah_kjv_1107_librivox","sections":[{"id":"66195","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
