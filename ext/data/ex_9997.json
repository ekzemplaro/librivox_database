His sister Iphigenia, who had been carried away by Diana from Aulis, when on the point of being sacrificed by her father, chances to be expiating a dream that led her to suppose Orestes dead, when a herdsman announces to her the arrival and detection of two strangers, whom she is bound by her office to sacrifice to Diana. On meeting, a mutual discovery takes place, and they plot their escape. - Summary by Theodore Buckley","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/15081","language":"English","copyright_year":"1892","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9997","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iphigenia_in_Tauris","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1247","first_name":"","last_name":"Euripides","dob":"484 BC","dod":"406 BC"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"343565","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"343566","section_number":"2","title":"Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"343567","section_number":"3","title":"Iphigenia","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/iphigeniaintauris_iphigenia.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"343568","section_number":"4","title":"Orestes","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343569","section_number":"5","title":"Pylades","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8164","display_name":"Rob Board"}]},{"id":"343570","section_number":"6","title":"Herdsman","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343571","section_number":"7","title":"Thoas","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7170","display_name":"alanmapstone"}]},{"id":"343572","section_number":"8","title":"Messenger","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343573","section_number":"9","title":"Minerva","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8883","display_name":"Lydia"}]},{"id":"343574","section_number":"10","title":"Chorus of Grecian Captive Women","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343575","section_number":"11","title":"Narrator","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"58","name":"Drama"}],"translators":[{"id":"6811","first_name":"Theodore Alois","last_name":"Buckley","dob":"1825","dod":"1856"}]}}}
