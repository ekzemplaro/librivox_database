{"books":{"22":{"id":"9289","title":"Aequanimitas and Other Addresses","description":"This book is a compilation of twenty-two addresses given by Sir William Osler in various settings. He spoke on the philosophical and moral foundations of medical science, giving instruction to the student the teacher, the physician and the nurse. In his own eloquent words, \"we are here not to get all we can out of life for ourselves, but to try to make the lives of others happier... The practice of medicine is an art, not a trade; a calling, not a business; a calling in which your heart will be exercised equally with your head. Often the best part of your work will have nothing to do with potions and powders, but with the exercise of and influence of the strong upon the weak, of the righteous upon the wicked, of the wise upon the foolish.\" -
