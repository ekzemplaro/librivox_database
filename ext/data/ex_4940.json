{"books":{"10":{"id":"4940","title":"Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit","description":"<p>Uncle Remus' stories feature a trickster hero called Br'er Rabbit (\"Brother\" Rabbit), who uses his wits to slide out of trouble and gain the advantage over the slower witted other animals, many of whom are trying to eat him. Br'er Rabbit stories were mostly collected directly from the afro-american oral story-telling tradition and are said to be a direct interpretation of Yoruba tales of Hare. This book contains 11 unique stories and was the last one published before the author's death.
