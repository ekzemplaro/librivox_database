{"books":{"22":{"id":"2502","title":"Summa Theologica - 02 Pars Prima, Trinity and Creation","description":"<p>The Summa Theologica (or the Summa Theologiae or simply the Summa, written 1265\u20131274) is the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas although it was never finished. It was intended as a manual for beginners as a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasonings for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God's creation, Man, Man's purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God. (Summary adapted from the Wikipedia)<br\/><br\/>\n\nThis is part two of six parts of the Pars Prima, consisting of questions regarding the Trinity and Creation.<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/17611","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2502","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/summa_1_02_jr_0907_librivox\/summa_1_02_jr_0907_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/summa-theologica-prima-pars-trinity-and-creation-by-saint-thomas-aquinas\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:41:51","totaltimesecs":38511,"authors":[{"id":"1199","first_name":"Saint Thomas","last_name":"Aquinas","dob":"1225","dod":"1274"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/summa_1_02_jr_0907_librivox","sections":[{"id":"166451","section_number":"1","title":"27 -
