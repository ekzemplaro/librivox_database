{"books":{"4":{"id":"3066","title":"Diary of a Superfluous Man","description":"<p>Turgenev's shy hero, Tchulkaturin, is a representative example of a Russian archetype - the \"superfluous man\", a sort of Hamlet not necessarily dignified with the title Prince: an individual of comfortable means leading a dreary existence, without purpose and led on by events which may, as in this story, engulf him. The novella takes the form of a diary started by Tchulkaturin in the shock of being diagnosed as having a terminal illness. The journal entries cover a period of two weeks, leading to his death. Tchulkaturin quickly homes in on the only significant event in his life - an unreciprocated falling-in-love leading haphazardly to a non-fatal duel that leaves him desolated and fully conscious of the futility of his inactive existence.(Summary by Martin Geeson)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/9615","language":"English","copyright_year":"1850","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3066","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox\/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-diary-of-a-superfluous-man-by-ivan-turgenev\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:37:04","totaltimesecs":9424,"authors":[{"id":"1364","first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Turgenev","dob":"1818","dod":"1883"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox","sections":[{"id":"178724","section_number":"1","title":"March 20, 18-- to March 23","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1869","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"178725","section_number":"2","title":"March 24","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1419","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"178726","section_number":"3","title":"March 25 and 26","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1757","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"178727","section_number":"4","title":"March 27","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1984","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"178728","section_number":"5","title":"March 29 to April 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2395","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"14","name":"Fictional Biographies & Memoirs"}],"translators":[{"id":"6497","first_name":" Constance","last_name":"Garnett","dob":"1861","dod":"1946"}]}}}
