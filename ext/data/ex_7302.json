{"books":{"47":{"id":"7302","title":"Pipefuls","description":"A delightful collection of 48 essays on various topics of the human condition that caught his fancy. Witty, insightful and funny of course and on occasion thought provoking and even disturbing. From the preface \"These sketches gave me pain to write; they will give the judicious patron pain to read; therefore we are quits. I think, as I look over their slattern paragraphs, of that most tragic hour\u2014it falls about 4 p. m. in the office of an evening newspaper\u2014when the unhappy compiler tries to round up the broodings of the day and still get home in time for supper. And yet perhaps the will-to-live is in them, for are they not a naked exhibit of the antics a man will commit in order to earn a living? In extenuation it may be pleaded that none of them are so long that they may not be mitigated by an accompanying pipe of tobacco.\" (Summary by phil chenevert) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/22699","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"48","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7302","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/pipefuls_1303_librivox\/pipefuls_1303_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/pipefuls-by-christopher-morley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:24:19","totaltimesecs":23059,"authors":[{"id":"2327","first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Morley","dob":"1890","dod":"1957"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/pipefuls_1303_librivox","sections":[{"id":"111610","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
