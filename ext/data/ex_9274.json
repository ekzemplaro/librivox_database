{"books":{"4":{"id":"9274","title":"Happy Prince and Other Tales","description":"A collection of five stories by Oscar Wilde, all incorporating his inimitable style and wit.  Sometimes sweet and uplifting, sometimes caustic and pointed, they all are well worth listening to.     The Happy Prince is a beautiful tale about a statue of a prince, but one who can now see his city and kingdom and the sadness of his people.  With the help of a little swallow he does what he can to help others.  The Nightingale and the Rose is a tale of self sacrifice, selfishness and misunderstanding.  The Selfish Giant learns a valuable lesson about the laughter of children, The Devoted Friend is a caustic tale about false friendship, and The Remarkable Rocket explores the self delusion of people (and rockets) who think the world revolves around them.
