{"books":{"20":{"id":"849","title":"Little Men","description":"Little Men (published 1871) is considered the second book of the Little Women trilogy written by Louisa May Alcott. (The book Good Wives (1869) was originally the sequel to the novel Little Women (1868), however those two novels are now usually published as a single volume.) The final book of the trilogy is Jo's Boys (1886). <p>\nLittle Men follows the life of Jo Bhaer and the students who live and learn at the Plumfield Estate School that she runs with her husband. The mischievous kids, whom she loves and cares for as her own, learn valuable lessons as they become proper gentlemen and ladies. We also get cameo appearances of almost all the characters found in the previous books, almost all of them happy and well.<p> (Summary from Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2788","language":"English","copyright_year":"1871","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/849","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/little_men_collab_librivox\/little_men_collab_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little_Men","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/little-men-by-louisa-may-alcott\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"9:44:28","totaltimesecs":35068,"authors":[{"id":"93","first_name":"Louisa May","last_name":"Alcott","dob":"1832","dod":"1888"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/little_men_collab_librivox","sections":[{"id":"133880","section_number":"1","title":"Nat","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1368","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1051","display_name":"E.
