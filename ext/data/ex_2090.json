{"books":{"9":{"id":"2090","title":"Constant Lover","description":"<br \/>Sir John Suckling (1609-42) was one of the Cavalier poets at the court of King Charles I of England. He took up arms in the conflicts of that era but was said to be more fit for the boudoir than the battlefield. He was a prolific lover, a sparkling wit and an excessive gamester and is credited with inventing the card game, Cribbage. Cavalier poetry was witty, decorous and sometimes naughty. The Constant Lover displays these elements as well as Suckling's conversational ease and charm.<br \/><br \/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/40\/234.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2090","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/constantlover_0805_librivox\/constantlover_0805_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-constant-lover-by-sir-john-suckling\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:09:27","totaltimesecs":567,"authors":[{"id":"1334","first_name":"Sir John","last_name":"Suckling","dob":"1609","dod":"1642"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/constantlover_0805_librivox","sections":[{"id":"157964","section_number":"1","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by AC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"45","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2587","display_name":"Anne Cheng"}]},{"id":"157965","section_number":"2","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by ACJ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"67","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2481","display_name":"Alana Jordan"}]},{"id":"157966","section_number":"3","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by CF","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"56","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1944","display_name":"Carolyn Frances"}]},{"id":"157967","section_number":"4","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by DES","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"56","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1759","display_name":"David Starner"}]},{"id":"157968","section_number":"5","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by DRB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"55","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"157969","section_number":"6","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by EZWA","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"55","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"157970","section_number":"7","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by JA","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"48","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1018","display_name":"JimmyLogan"}]},{"id":"157971","section_number":"8","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by LAH","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"52","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"157972","section_number":"9","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by SAC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"84","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2623","display_name":"Sally Ann Cook"}]},{"id":"157973","section_number":"10","title":"The Constant Lover - Read by STL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"49","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"240","display_name":"Shurtagal"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
