{"books":{"31":{"id":"9750","title":"Letter Of Credit","description":"\"Rotha is a poor American girl who has to see both her parents die. All that time, she is comforted by an English friend of the family, Mr. Digby-Southwode. Mr. Digby-Southwode thinks he does the right thing by committing Rotha to the care of her wealthy aunt, a woman who wronged her mother and robbed her of her rightful fortune,  while he returns to England to nurse his dying father. Would the wealthy aunt treat Rotha as she treated her mother or is there a chance for redemption? And would Mr. Digby-Southwode ever return to America and see Rotha again? The book is very modern in tone.  - Summary by Stav Nisser<br>\nProof-listened by <a href=\"https:\/\/librivox.org\/reader\/8072\">Kimberly Krause<\/a> and <a
