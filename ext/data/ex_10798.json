{"books":{"4":{"id":"10798","title":"Midsummer Night's Dream (version 4)","description":"Even people who claim to hate Shakespearean comedy have to admit that they love A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\nThe original play is already naturally divided into three realms: the mortal world, the faerie realm and the play within the play, thus it presents the perfect opportunity to double and triple cast the same actors. So it was really only a matter of time till somebody came up with the crazy idea to stage the whole thing with only three people.<\/p>\nThose crazy people are Tony Addison, John Burlinson and Sonia. The outcome of their collaboration is a 3 hour tour-de-force full of surprises: special effects, music, songs. True to the Shakespearean spirit, cross-gender casting was a must, so don't be alarmed when Titania (who will shatter all your preconceptions of the term \"fairy queen\" forever) enters the stage.\nNow you're forewarned, and if you still think you're ready, settle back in your armchair and let a bit of faerie into your world. We hope you enjoy the ride.\n(Summary by Tony Addison, John Burlinson and Sonia)<\/p>\n ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1514","language":"English","copyright_year":"1998","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10798","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/midsummer_nights_dream4_1604_librivox\/midsummer_nights_dream4_1604_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-midsummer-nights-dream-version-4-by-william-shakespeare\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:07:55","totaltimesecs":11275,"authors":[{"id":"37","first_name":"William","last_name":"Shakespeare","dob":"1564","dod":"1616"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/midsummer_nights_dream4_1604_librivox","sections":[{"id":"367589","section_number":"1","title":"Act One","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/midsummernightsdream4_01_shakespeare.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1882","file_name":"a_midsummer_nights_dream_version_4_01_shakespeare_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10179","display_name":"Sonia"},{"reader_id":"10289","display_name":"Tony Addison"},{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"367590","section_number":"2","title":"Act Two","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/midsummernightsdream4_02_shakespeare.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2227","file_name":"a_midsummer_nights_dream_version_4_02_shakespeare_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10179","display_name":"Sonia"},{"reader_id":"10289","display_name":"Tony Addison"},{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"367591","section_number":"3","title":"Act Three","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/midsummernightsdream4_03_shakespeare.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3478","file_name":"a_midsummer_nights_dream_version_4_03_shakespeare_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10179","display_name":"Sonia"},{"reader_id":"10289","display_name":"Tony Addison"},{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"367592","section_number":"4","title":"Act Four","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/midsummernightsdream4_04_shakespeare.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1496","file_name":"a_midsummer_nights_dream_version_4_04_shakespeare_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10179","display_name":"Sonia"},{"reader_id":"10289","display_name":"Tony Addison"},{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"367593","section_number":"5","title":"Act Five","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/midsummernightsdream4_05_shakespeare.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2192","file_name":"a_midsummer_nights_dream_version_4_05_shakespeare_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10179","display_name":"Sonia"},{"reader_id":"10289","display_name":"Tony Addison"},{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"24","name":"Plays"}],"translators":[]}}}
