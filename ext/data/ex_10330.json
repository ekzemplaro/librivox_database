His works have formed the basis of much of the curriculum used today by many motivational and self-help groups.\nHis first book, which published in 1901, was From Poverty to Power, subtitled The Realization of Prosperity and Peace. Allen described this book as \"A Book for all those who are in search of better conditions, wider freedom, and increased usefulness.\"\nOrinigally ,the book consisted of two separate volumes, The Path To Prosperity (sometimes rendered as The Path of Prosperity) and The Way of Peace.  Each volume was later published separately.
