{"books":{"30":{"id":"4696","title":"God and my Neighbour","description":"\"I have been asked why I have opposed Christianity. I have several reasons, which shall appear in due course. At present I offer one. <br>\nI oppose Christianity because it is not true.<br>\nNo honest man will ask for any other reason. But it may be asked why I say that Christianity is not true; and that is a very proper question, which I shall do my best to answer.\" <br><br>Thus states the author in one of the first chapters of this book, and subsequently he lays down his apology, drawing his conclusions from numerous books published by believers and unbelievers alike, and, of course, from the bible itself.
