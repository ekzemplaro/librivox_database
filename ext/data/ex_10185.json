He opened a furniture factory on the river as well as a store which sold furniture, along with such items as pianos and coffins.<\/p>\n\nHe was well loved in the community, from which he often received aid in hard times, due in part to his poesy and oratorical skills\u2014he was called on to speak at every kind of social gathering in Ingersoll. The region seems to have inspired him, and it was in celebration of the proud history of Canada, the natural beauty and industry of the region, and especially (as noted above) its cheese, that the majority of his oeuvre was written. - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/36068","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10185","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox\/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/tramp-and-fish-by-james-mcintyre\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:08:51","totaltimesecs":531,"authors":[{"id":"2285","first_name":"James","last_name":"McIntyre","dob":"1828","dod":"1906"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"348794","section_number":"1","title":"Tramp and Fish - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/trampandfish_mcintyre_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"85","file_name":"trampandfish_mcintyre_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"348795","section_number":"2","title":"Tramp and Fish - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/trampandfish_mcintyre_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"88","file_name":"trampandfish_mcintyre_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"348793","section_number":"3","title":"Tramp and Fish - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/trampandfish_mcintyre_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"104","file_name":"trampandfish_mcintyre_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"348796","section_number":"4","title":"Tramp and Fish - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/trampandfish_mcintyre_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"82","file_name":"trampandfish_mcintyre_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
