{"books":{"14":{"id":"10772","title":"Fortune of the Rougons","description":"The Fortune of the Rougons (French: La Fortune des Rougon), originally published in 1871, is the first novel in \u00c9mile Zola's monumental twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. The novel is partly an origin story, with a huge cast of characters swarming around - many of whom become the central figures of later novels in the series - and partly an account of the December 1851 coup d'\u00e9tat that created the French Second Empire under Napoleon III as experienced in a large provincial town in southern France. The title refers not only to the \"fortune\" chased by protagonists Pierre and Felicit\u00e9 Rougon, but also to the fortunes of the various disparate family members Zola introduces, whose lives are of central importance to later books in the series.  - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":" http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5135 ","language":"English","copyright_year":"1898","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10772","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Fortune_of_the_Rougons","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1233","first_name":"\u00c9mile","last_name":"Zola","dob":"1840","dod":"1902"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"366760","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction and Author's Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/fortuneoftherougons_00_zola_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366761","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1, Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/fortuneoftherougons_01_zola_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366762","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 1, Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/fortuneoftherougons_02_zola_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366763","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 2, Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/fortuneoftherougons_03_zola_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366764","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 2, Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/fortuneoftherougons_04_zola_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366765","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 3, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366766","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 3, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366767","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 4, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366768","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 4, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366769","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 5, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366770","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 5, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366771","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 6, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366772","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 6, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366773","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 7, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]},{"id":"366886","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 7, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8799","display_name":"Peter Tucker"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"18","name":"Historical Fiction"}],"translators":[{"id":"6782","first_name":" Ernest Alfred","last_name":"Vizetelly","dob":"1853","dod":"1922"}]}}}
