{"books":{"9":{"id":"2530","title":"Short Science Fiction Collection 008","description":"<p>This volume of the LibriVox Science-Fiction Collection is devoted to Alan E. Nourse (1928-1992).  Nourse became a science fiction writer to help pay for his medical education, but eventually retired from practicing medicine to pursue his writing career. This reader-selected collection presents ten of his short stories which were published between 1954 and 1963. Extensive research by Project Gutenberg volunteers did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on these publications were renewed.  Please consider this a brief sampling of Nourse's full range, and have fun buying and borrowing his other works. <br \/><br \/>Summary adapted from Wikipedia by Cori Samuel.<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/browse\/authors\/n#a25579","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2530","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/short_scifi_008_0810_librivox\/short_scifi_008_0810_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/short-science-fiction-collection-vol-008\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:59:41","totaltimesecs":17981,"authors":[{"id":"2691","first_name":"Alan Edward","last_name":"Nourse","dob":"1928","dod":"1992"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/short_scifi_008_0810_librivox","sections":[{"id":"167036","section_number":"1","title":"Circus","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1174","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"644","display_name":"Daniele"}]},{"id":"167037","section_number":"2","title":"The Coffin Cure","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1780","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"167038","section_number":"3","title":"Letter of the Law","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2574","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"644","display_name":"Daniele"}]},{"id":"167039","section_number":"4","title":"The Link","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2188","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3098","display_name":"woggy298"}]},{"id":"167040","section_number":"5","title":"Meeting of the Board","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2132","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2936","display_name":"Corey M.
