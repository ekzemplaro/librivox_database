{"books":{"24":{"id":"9519","title":"Hunters of the Hills","description":"\"The Hunters of the Hills\" is the first volume of a series dealing with the great struggle of France and England and their colonies for dominion in North America, culminating with the fall of Quebec. It is also concerned to a large extent with the Iroquois, the mighty league known in their own language as the Hodenosaunee, for the favor of which both French and English were high bidders. In his treatment of the theme the author has consulted many authorities, and he is not conscious of any historical error. - Summary by  from the Preface","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/14890","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"25","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9519","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2503","first_name":"Joseph A.","last_name":"Altsheler","dob":"1862","dod":"1919"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"328743","section_number":"1","title":"Ch 1: The Three Friends, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9768","display_name":"Fatemah Akbar"}]},{"id":"328744","section_number":"2","title":"Ch 1: The Three Friends, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328745","section_number":"3","title":"Ch 2: St Luc","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9627","display_name":"Jeremiah Sutherland"}]},{"id":"328746","section_number":"4","title":"Ch 3: The Tomahawk","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9627","display_name":"Jeremiah Sutherland"}]},{"id":"328747","section_number":"5","title":"Ch 4: The Intelligent Canoe, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328748","section_number":"6","title":"Ch 4: The Intelligent Canoe, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328749","section_number":"7","title":"Ch 5: The Mohawk Chief, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328750","section_number":"8","title":"Ch 5: The Mohawk Chief, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328751","section_number":"9","title":"Ch 6: The Two Frenchmen","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328752","section_number":"10","title":"Ch 7: New France","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328753","section_number":"11","title":"Ch 8: Guests of the Enemy, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328754","section_number":"12","title":"Ch 8: Guests of the Enemy, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328755","section_number":"13","title":"Ch 9: At the Inn","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328756","section_number":"14","title":"Ch 10: The Meeting","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328757","section_number":"15","title":"Ch 11: Bigot's Ball, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328758","section_number":"16","title":"Ch 11: Bigot's Ball, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328759","section_number":"17","title":"Ch 12: The Hunter and the Bravo, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328760","section_number":"18","title":"Ch 12: The Hunter and the Bravo, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328761","section_number":"19","title":"Ch 13: The Bowmen, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328762","section_number":"20","title":"Ch 13: The Bowmen, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328763","section_number":"21","title":"Ch 14: On Champlain, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328764","section_number":"22","title":"Ch 14: On Champlain, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328765","section_number":"23","title":"Ch 15: The Vale of Onondaga, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328766","section_number":"24","title":"Ch 15: The Vale of Onondaga, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"328767","section_number":"25","title":"Ch 16: The Great Test","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"37","name":"Action & Adventure"}],"translators":[]}}}
