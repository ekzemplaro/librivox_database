{"books":{"2":{"id":"5596","title":"History of Farming in Ontario","description":"This is a paper on the history of farming in Ontario. It take the reader through the early settlement from 1783 to the modern period of 1888-1912. We see how farming and farm industries developed and how the population was distributed during these times. We see the trends of settlers moving into the Urban centers instead of rural and how the farm industries (making cheese, butter, wool, etc) move off the farm to the city factories.\n<BR>\nExcerpt: \u201cThe farmer\u2019s wife in those days was perhaps the most expert master of trades ever known. She could spin and weave, make a carpet or a rug, dye yarns and clothes, and make a straw hat or a birch broom. Butter, cheese, and maple sugar were products of her skill, as well as bread, soap, canned fruits, and home-made wine. In those days the farm was a miniature factory or combination of factories.\u201d (Summary by Esther)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30808","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5596","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/history_farming_ontario_1111_ehl\/history_farming_ontario_1111_ehl_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/history-of-farming-in-ontario-by-c-c-james\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:23:27","totaltimesecs":5007,"authors":[{"id":"2645","first_name":"C.
