{"books":{"23":{"id":"2732","title":"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions","description":"<p>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions is a 1624 prose work by the English writer John Donne. It is a series of reflections that were written as Donne recovered from a serious illness, believed to be either typhus or relapsing fever. (Donne does not clearly identify the disease in his text.) The work consists of twenty-three parts describing each stage of the sickness. Each part is further divided into a Meditation, an Expostulation, and a Prayer.<br \/><br \/>The seventeenth meditation is perhaps the best-known part of the work. It contains the following passage:<br \/>\"No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\" (Summary by Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/23772","language":"English","copyright_year":"1624","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2732","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/devotions_emerg-occs_0905_librivox\/devotions_emerg-occs_0905_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Devotions_upon_Emergent_Occasions","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/devotions-upon-emergent-occasions-by-john-donne\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:59:21","totaltimesecs":21561,"authors":[{"id":"742","first_name":"John","last_name":"Donne","dob":"1572","dod":"1631"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/devotions_emerg-occs_0905_librivox","sections":[{"id":"171620","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Dedication","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"156","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1469","display_name":"Fr.
