{"books":{"11":{"id":"8682","title":"Anthem, Version 4","description":"Ayn Rand is best known for her classics Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. One of her earlier works, Anthem, is a dystopian vision of a world in which \u201cself\u201d has been abolished and people have become nothing more than parts of a greater \u201ccollective.\u201d Rooted in her own experiences fleeing from the communist Russia of the 1920\u2019s, as well as the rise of fascism in Italy and National Socialism in Germany, Rand wrote Anthem as a warning to all concerned with losing personal identity in an ever changing and rapidly developing world.
