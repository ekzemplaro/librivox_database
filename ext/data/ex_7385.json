{"books":{"20":{"id":"7385","title":"Annie Besant","description":"In her autobiography, Annie Besant poignantly writes of her search for the truth of what she believed in, leaving Christianity behind to embrace Atheism, and ultimately finding her peace in Theosophy, which she became interested in after meeting Helena Blavatsky. She moved to India to better study Theosophical ideas and this is where she made her home until her death. She was a gifted orator and writer, often speaking and writing on her religious beliefs, as well as women's rights and social reform. Along with Charles Bradlaugh, she published a paper in support of birth control. It proved to be so controversial for the times that it led to a court trial.\r\n\r\nAnnie Besant was a remarkable woman, suffering much for her beliefs but steadfastly continuing on in her pursuit in spite of it.
