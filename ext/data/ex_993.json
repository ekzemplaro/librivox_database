{"books":{"11":{"id":"993","title":"Utopia (Burnet translation)","description":"<br \/>This book is all about the fictional country called Utopia. It is a country with an \u2018ideal\u2019 form of communism, in which everything really does belong to everybody, everyone does the work they want to, and everyone is alright with that. This country uses gold for chamber pots and prison chains, pearls and diamonds for children\u2019s playthings, and requires that a man and a woman see each other exactly as they are, naked, before getting married. This book gave the word 'utopia' the meaning of a perfect society, while the Greek word actually means \u2018no place\u2019. Enjoy listening to this story about a country that really is too good to be true. (Summary by Jenilee.)<br \/><br \/>\nThis is the 17th century translation by Gilbert Burnet, edited in the 19th century by Henry Morley.<br \/><br \/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2130","language":"English","copyright_year":"1516","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/993","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/utopia_j_librivox\/utopia_j_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Utopia_(book)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/utopia-by-thomas-more\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:53:48","totaltimesecs":14028,"authors":[{"id":"2660","first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"More","dob":"1478","dod":"1535"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/utopia_j_librivox","sections":[{"id":"136517","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"505","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136518","section_number":"1","title":"Discourses of Raphael Hythloday, of the Best State of a Commonwealth","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1614","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136519","section_number":"2","title":"Discourses (pt 2)","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1693","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136520","section_number":"3","title":"Discourses (pt 3)","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1185","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136521","section_number":"4","title":"Of Their Towns, Particularly of Amaurot","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"327","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136522","section_number":"5","title":"Of Their Magistrates","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"190","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136523","section_number":"6","title":"Of Their Trades, and Manner of Life","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"610","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136524","section_number":"7","title":"Of Their Traffic","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"689","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136525","section_number":"8","title":"Of the Travelling of the Utopians","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2585","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136526","section_number":"9","title":"Of Their Slaves, and Of Their Marriages","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1166","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136527","section_number":"10","title":"Of Their Military Discipline","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1201","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]},{"id":"136528","section_number":"11","title":"Of the Religions of the Utopians","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2263","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1266","display_name":"Jenilee"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"52","name":"Published before 1800"},{"id":"124","name":"Medieval"}],"translators":[{"id":"10106","first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"Burnet","dob":"1643","dod":"1715"}]}}}
