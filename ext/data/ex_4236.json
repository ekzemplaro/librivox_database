{"books":{"23":{"id":"4236","title":"Homeri Odyssea","description":"<p>Samuel Clarke\u2019s translation of the Odyssey accompanied many editions of Homer in the 18th and early 19th century. A word-for-word translation, which keeps the exact order of the Greek original, it is essentially a crib to help in reading the original.
