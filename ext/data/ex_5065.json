{"books":{"20":{"id":"5065","title":"Ottawa Folk Festival Robert Service Collection","description":"On August 13-15, 2010, A hearty band of Librivox volunteers, led by Bob Ledrew and Sean McGaughey, recorded selections from the Spell of the Yukon by Robert Service with patrons, musicians and organizers of the festival. We chose Robert Service because he is an iconic Canadian poet. It was our intention to record the whole volume, but the festival was disrupted by torrential rains on its final day.
