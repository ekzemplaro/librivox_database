{"books":{"3":{"id":"7063","title":"Told Under a White Oak Tree","description":"An inside look into the wild world of silent movie cowboy William S. Hart... as narrated by his horse! This is a fascinating (if fictionalized) behind-the-scenes look into the wild, action-packed world of a Hollywood cowboy and stuntman. TOLD UNDER A WHITE OAK TREE is a charming children's book that not only gives us a fanciful account of Hart's career as Hollywood's premier western hero, but also tells a rousing adventure story of his exceptional (if somewhat smart-alecky) equine companion, who strives to become as renowned a screen legend as his master.\n\nCaution: This book contains a couple of racial epithets that may be offensive to some readers. Turns out horses aren't very progressive or PC.
