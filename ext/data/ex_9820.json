{"books":{"19":{"id":"9820","title":"Devotions Upon Emergent Occassions (Version 2)","description":"These essays, published three years before his daughter Lucy died, are John Donne's meditations on the experience of one's health being unexpectedly compromised, and on having to face extended illness and the possibility or perhaps the likelihood of death, as well as its aftermath.  They display the poet Donne's parallel mastery of prose style.  Hemingway's <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls<\/i> was inspired by  Meditation XVII, and Thomas Merton's <i>No Man is an Island<\/i> took its title from a prayer in <i>The Devotions<\/i>.
