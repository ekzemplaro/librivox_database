{"books":{"16":{"id":"2802","title":"Discoverers and Explorers","description":"Tales of the brave and daring explorers that ventured into the unknown \"Sea of Darkness\" where it was thought monsters and angry gods lived. They dared to sail near the equator which was thought to have such intense heat that it would boil the ocean water. It was also commonly thought at the time that the world was flat, and the ships would fall off the face of the earth. These men overcame these fears to explore and discover new lands.
