{"books":{"45":{"id":"3276","title":"New Grub Street","description":"\"The story deals with the literary world that Gissing himself had experienced. Its title refers to the London street, Grub Street, which in the 18th century became synomynous with hack literature; as an institution, Grub Street itself no longer existed in Gissing's time. Its two central characters are a sharply contrasted pair of writers:\nEdwin Reardon, a novelist of some talent but limited commercial prospects, and a shy, cerebral man; and Jasper Milvain, a young journalist, hard-working and capable of generosity, but cynical and unscrupulous about writing and its purpose in the modern (i.e. late Victorian) world\".\nSummary from Wikipedia.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1709","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"46","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3276","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/grub_street_1001_librivox\/grub_street_1001_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/www.en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Grub_Street","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/new-grub-street-by-george-gissing\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"19:34:34","totaltimesecs":70474,"authors":[{"id":"319","first_name":"George","last_name":"Gissing","dob":"1857","dod":"1903"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/grub_street_1001_librivox","sections":[{"id":"11013","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 01 -
