{"books":{"4":{"id":"1576","title":"Astrophil and Stella","description":"Astrophil and Stella is a sonnet sequence written by Philip Sidney, an Elizabethan poet and courtier. It details the frustrated love of Astrophil (whose name means \"star-lover\") for his beloved Stella (whose name means \"star\"). It is likely that Sidney based his poems on his own unrequited passion for a married woman. The sequence inspired other sonnet writers of the period, such as Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, and Lady Mary Wroth.
