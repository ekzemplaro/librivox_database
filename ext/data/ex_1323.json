{"books":{"20":{"id":"1323","title":"Mike: A Public School Story","description":"<p>This novel introduces the characters Mike Jackson and Psmith, who are featured in several of Wodehouse\u2019s later works. It shows how the two characters first met each other as teenagers at boarding school. As Psmith doesn\u2019t appear until about halfway through this book, it was later released as two separate books, <i>Mike at Wrykyn<\/i> and <i>Mike and Psmith<\/i>. There\u2019s lots of cricket, but you don\u2019t need to understand the game to enjoy the antics of these public school boys as they \"rag\" each other and the authorities.<br \/><br \/>-Summary by Debra Lynn<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/7423","language":"English","copyright_year":"1909","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1323","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/mike_wodehouse_dl_librivox\/mike_wodehouse_dl_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mike_(novel)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/mike-a-public-school-story-by-p-g-wodehouse\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:54:57","totaltimesecs":39297,"authors":[{"id":"420","first_name":"P.
