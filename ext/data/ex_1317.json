{"books":{"14":{"id":"1317","title":"Problems of Philosophy","description":"The Problems of Philosophy is one of Bertrand Russell's attempts to create a brief and accessible guide to the problems of philosophy. Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics.<br><\/br>Russell guides the reader through his famous distinction between \"knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description\" and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel and others to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.
