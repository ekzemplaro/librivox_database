The War Service of Sherlock Holmes\" (1917). The collection's first US edition adjusts the anthology's subtitle to Some Later Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes. All editions contain a brief preface, by \"John H. Watson, M.D.\", that assures readers that as of the date of publication (1917), Holmes is long retired from his profession of detective but is still alive and well, albeit suffering from a touch of rheumatism. - Summary by David Clarke","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2350","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10539","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/his_last_bow_version_3_1603_librivox\/his_last_bow_version_3_1603_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/His_Last_Bow","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"07:10:29","totaltimesecs":25829,"authors":[{"id":"467","first_name":"Sir Arthur Conan","last_name":"Doyle","dob":"1859","dod":"1930"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/his_last_bow_version_3_1603_librivox","sections":[{"id":"359763","section_number":"1","title":"The Singular Experience of Mr John Scott Eccles","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_01_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1865","file_name":"hislastbow_01_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"359764","section_number":"2","title":"The Tiger of San Pedro","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_02_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2660","file_name":"hislastbow_02_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"359765","section_number":"3","title":"The Adventure of The Cardboard Box","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_03_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2990","file_name":"hislastbow_03_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"359766","section_number":"4","title":"The Adventure of the Red Circle Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_04_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1560","file_name":"hislastbow_04_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"359767","section_number":"5","title":"The Adventure of the Red Circle Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_05_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1359","file_name":"hislastbow_05_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"359768","section_number":"6","title":"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_06_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"4104","file_name":"hislastbow_06_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"359769","section_number":"7","title":"The Adventure of the Dying Detective","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_07_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2301","file_name":"hislastbow_07_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"359770","section_number":"8","title":"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_08_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2905","file_name":"hislastbow_08_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"362194","section_number":"9","title":"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_09_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3706","file_name":"hislastbow_09_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"362195","section_number":"10","title":"His Last Bow","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/hislastbow_10_doyle_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2379","file_name":"hislastbow_10_doyle_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"5","name":"Crime & Mystery Fiction"},{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
