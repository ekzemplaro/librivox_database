{"books":{"12":{"id":"7244","title":"Vassar Studies","description":"Published in 1899, Vassar Studies is a collection of twelve realistic glimpses into the character of attending students at Vassar College. It delves more with the inner workings of people rather than with dramatic incidents or what was studied in college. The glimpses themselves are both wordy and enlightening. The dialogue within each tends to have a background of various people, some with names and some who remain nameless as part of the scenery. The manner in which they speak may be surprisingly academic for those used to college girl stories of the adventurous or mysterious nature. <p>Julia Augusta Schwartz graduated from Vassar in 1896 and earned an MA in English literature the following year.
