{"books":{"22":{"id":"7710","title":"Adventures of Grandfather Frog","description":"Longlegs the Blue Heron felt decidedly out of sorts. It was a beautiful morning, too beautiful for any one to be feeling that way. Indeed, it was the same beautiful morning in which Grandfather Frog had caught so many foolish green flies. Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was smiling his broadest. The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind were dancing happily here and there over the Green Meadows, looking for some good turn to do for others. The little feathered people to whom Old Mother Nature has given the great blessing of music in their throats were pouring out their sweetest songs. So it seemed as if there was no good reason why Longlegs should feel out of sorts. The fact is the trouble with Longlegs was an empty stomach. Yes, Sir, that is what ailed Longlegs the Blue Heron that sunshiny morning. You know it is hard work to be hungry and happy at the same time. (Summary by Thornton W. Burgess in Chapter 2) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/14375","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7710","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/grandfatherfrog_1305_librivox\/grandfatherfrog_1305_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-adventures-of-grandfather-frog-by-thornton-w-burgess\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:06:25","totaltimesecs":7585,"authors":[{"id":"282","first_name":"Thornton W.","last_name":"Burgess","dob":"1874","dod":"1965"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/grandfatherfrog_1305_librivox","sections":[{"id":"118644","section_number":"1","title":"Billy Mink Finds Little Joe Otter","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"330","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7925","display_name":"Etel Buss"}]},{"id":"118645","section_number":"2","title":"Longlegs The Blue Heron Receives Callers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"301","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8293","display_name":"Leah Sosewitz"}]},{"id":"118646","section_number":"3","title":"Longlegs Visits The Smiling Pool","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"284","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8293","display_name":"Leah Sosewitz"}]},{"id":"118647","section_number":"4","title":"The Patience Of Longlegs The Blue Heron","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"312","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7850","display_name":"Jill Engle"}]},{"id":"118648","section_number":"5","title":"Grandfather Frog Jumps Just In Time","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"319","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7608","display_name":"rookieblue"}]},{"id":"118649","section_number":"6","title":"Longlegs And Whitetail Quarrel","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"319","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"118650","section_number":"7","title":"Grandfather Frog's Big Mouth Gets Him In Trouble","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"345","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"118651","section_number":"8","title":"Spotty The Turtle Plays Doctor","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"328","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"118652","section_number":"9","title":"Old Mr. Toad Visits Grandfather Frog","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"479","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"118653","section_number":"10","title":"Grandfather Frog Starts Out To See The Great World","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"305","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"118654","section_number":"11","title":"Grandfather Frog Is Stubborn","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"356","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7997","display_name":"Tom Merritt"}]},{"id":"118655","section_number":"12","title":"Grandfather Frog Keeps On","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"310","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]},{"id":"118656","section_number":"13","title":"Danny Meadow Mouse Feels Responsible","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"316","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]},{"id":"118657","section_number":"14","title":"Grandfather Frog Has A Strange Ride","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"310","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]},{"id":"118658","section_number":"15","title":"Grandfather Frog Gives Up Hope","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"307","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]},{"id":"118659","section_number":"16","title":"The Merry Little Breezes Work Hard","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"349","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8199","display_name":"maryagneskatherine"}]},{"id":"118660","section_number":"17","title":"Striped Chipmunk Cuts The String","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"431","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8199","display_name":"maryagneskatherine"}]},{"id":"118661","section_number":"18","title":"Grandfather Frog Hurries Away","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"313","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8199","display_name":"maryagneskatherine"}]},{"id":"118662","section_number":"19","title":"Grandfather Frog Jumps Into More Trouble","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"322","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7786","display_name":"Kevin W.
