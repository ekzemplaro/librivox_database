It is traditionally read by the Jewish people on Tisha B'Av, the fast day that commemorates the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. It is called in the Hebrew canon 'Eikhah, meaning \"How,\" being the formula for the commencement of a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see 2 Sam. 1:19-27). The Septuagint adopted the name rendered \"Lamentations\" (Greek threnoi = Hebrew qinoth) now in common use, to denote the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on Jerusalem and the Holy Land by the Chaldeans. In the Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Ketuvim, the Writings. <br\/>(Summary by Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.ebible.org\/asv\/Lament.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"2","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2204","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/the_lamentations_of_jeremiah_ss_librivox\/the_lamentations_of_jeremiah_ss_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-lamentations-of-jeremiah-asv\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:24:41","totaltimesecs":1481,"authors":[{"id":"187","first_name":"","last_name":"American Standard Version","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/the_lamentations_of_jeremiah_ss_librivox","sections":[{"id":"160152","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Chapters 1-3","listen_url":"http:\/\/linux.wku.edu\/~stinssd\/audio\/lamentations\/lamentations_01-03_asv.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1068","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"160153","section_number":"2","title":"2 - Chapters 4-5","listen_url":"http:\/\/linux.wku.edu\/~stinssd\/audio\/lamentations\/lamentations_04-05_asv.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"413","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"79","name":"Bibles"}],"translators":[]}}}
