{"books":{"34":{"id":"4566","title":"Mother Carey\u2019s Chickens","description":"<p>\u201cWhen Captain Carey went on his long journey into the unknown and uncharted land, the rest of the Careys tried in vain for a few months to be still a family, and did not succeed at all. They clung as closely to one another as ever they could, but there was always a gap in the circle where father had been\u2026.. The only thing to do was to remember father's pride and justify it, to recall his care for mother and take his place so far as might be; the only thing for all, as the months went on, was to be what mother called the three Bs -- brave, bright, and busy.\"<br><\/br>\nFrom the author of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, this book tells the story of a widow and her four children, forced to leave their home due to financial difficulties, and move to the \u201cYellow House\u201d in turn of the century Beulah, Maine. The Disney movie \u201cSummer Magic\u201d starring Hayley Mills was loosely based on this book.
