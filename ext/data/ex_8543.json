{"books":{"18":{"id":"8543","title":"American Crisis aka \"The Crisis\"","description":"The American Crisis is a pamphlet series by 18th century Enlightenment philosopher and author Thomas Paine, originally published from 1776 to 1783 during the American Revolution. Often known as The American Crisis or simply The Crisis, there are sixteen pamphlets in total. Thirteen numbered pamphlets were published between 1776 and 1777, with three additional pamphlets released between 1777 and 1783. Paine signed the pamphlets with the pseudonym, \"Common Sense.\"\n\nThe pamphlets were contemporaneous with early parts of the American Revolution, during a time when colonists needed inspiring works. They were written in a language that the common man could understand, and represented Paine's liberal philosophy. Paine's writings bolstered the morale of the American colonists, appealed to the English people's consideration of the war with America, clarified the issues at stake in the war, and denounced the advocates of a negotiated peace. The first volume begins with the famous words \"These are the times that try men's souls.\" - Summary by Michele Fry","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/3741","language":"English","copyright_year":"1894","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8543","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox\/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-american-crisis-aka-the-crisis-by-thomas-paine\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"08:19:14","totaltimesecs":29954,"authors":[{"id":"2273","first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Paine","dob":"1737","dod":"1809"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox","sections":[{"id":"302300","section_number":"0","title":"Editor's Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/thecrisis_00_paine_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"114","file_name":"theamericancrisis_00_paine_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"302301","section_number":"1","title":"Crisis I, These Are The Times That Try Men's Souls","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/thecrisis_01_paine_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1391","file_name":"theamericancrisis_01_paine_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6311","display_name":"TRUEBRIT"}]},{"id":"302302","section_number":"2","title":"Crisis II, To Lord Howe","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/thecrisis_02_paine_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2474","file_name":"theamericancrisis_02_paine_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"302303","section_number":"3","title":"Crisis III, Part I, In The Progress Of Politics","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/thecrisis_3_paine_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2562","file_name":"theamericancrisis_03_paine_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9164","display_name":"Max Wainer"}]},{"id":"302304","section_number":"4","title":"Crisis III, Part II, In The Progress Of Politics","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/thecrisis_04_paine_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2109","file_name":"theamericancrisis_04_paine_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9164","display_name":"Max Wainer"}]},{"id":"302305","section_number":"5","title":"Crisis IV, Those Who Expect To Reap The Blessings Of Freedom","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/thecrisis_05_paine_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"516","file_name":"theamericancrisis_05_paine_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8463","display_name":"Michele Fry"}]},{"id":"302306","section_number":"6","title":"Crisis V, Part I, To Gen.
