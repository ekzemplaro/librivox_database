It was intended as a manual for beginners as a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasonings for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God's creation, Man, Man's purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God.(Summary adapted from the Wikipedia)\n\nThis is part one of six parts of the Pars Prima, consisting of the Initial Questions.<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/17611","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2443","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/summa_1_01_jr_0901_librivox\/summa_1_01_jr_0901_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/summa-theologica-prima-pars-questions-1-26-by-thomas-aquinas\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"12:44:37","totaltimesecs":45877,"authors":[{"id":"1199","first_name":"Saint Thomas","last_name":"Aquinas","dob":"1225","dod":"1274"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/summa_1_01_jr_0901_librivox","sections":[{"id":"164832","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
