Three gentlemen of little means and no occupation meet in the Bohemian Cigar Divan, a tobacco shop with couches to sit and smoke. They read of a reward offered for information as to the whereabouts of a man with big moustaches and a sealskin coat. They agree among themselves that they will separate and search for the man so as to claim the reward. The stories that follow concern their adventures. They meet again in the cigar divan in an epilogue to their travels. (Summary by Don W. Jenkins) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/647","language":"English","copyright_year":"1885","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6276","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/dynamiter_dj_librivox\/dynamiter_dj_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/more-new-arabian-nights-the-dynamiter-by-robert-louis-and-fanny-van-de-grift-stevenson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:25:21","totaltimesecs":26721,"authors":[{"id":"6287","first_name":" Fanny van DerGrift","last_name":"Stevenson","dob":"","dod":""},{"id":"115","first_name":"Robert Louis","last_name":"Stevenson","dob":"1850","dod":"1894"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/dynamiter_dj_librivox","sections":[{"id":"87244","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Prologue of the Cigar Divan","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1219","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5304","display_name":"Don W.
