{"books":{"5":{"id":"1111","title":"Typhoon","description":"<p><i>Typhoon<\/i> is a short novel by Joseph Conrad, begun in 1899 and published in <i>Pall Mall Magazine<\/i> in 1902. It is a classic sea yarn that describes how Captain Macwhirr sails the Siamese steamer Nan-Shan into a typhoon. Other characters include the young Jukes and Solomon, the head engineer. The novel classically evokes the sea-faring life at the turn of the century. While Macwhirr is emotionally estranged from his family and crew, and though he refuses to consider an alternate course to skirt the typhoon, his indomitable will in the face of a superior natural force elicits grudging admiration.
