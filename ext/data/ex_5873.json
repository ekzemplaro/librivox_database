{"books":{"10":{"id":"5873","title":"How to Care for the Insane","description":"\"The writer believes that all attendants should be regularly instructed in their duties, and the highest standard of care can be reached only when this is done. He also believes that every person who is allowed to care for the insane will be greatly benefited by such instruction, and will be able to learn every thing taught, if the teacher uses simple methods and is patient to instruct.\"<br\/><br\/>\n\nAs this manual was originally written in 1886, the basic medical instruction IS out-of-date and should not be used to diagnose any medical problem, nor should be used in the case of an emergency. It has been recorded for entertainment purposes only!<br\/>\n\n(Summary from the Introduction and by Ann Boulais)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/37142","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5873","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/care_insane_ab_librivox\/care_insane_ab_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/how-to-care-for-the-insane-by-william-d-granger\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:01:37","totaltimesecs":10897,"authors":[{"id":"2258","first_name":"William D.","last_name":"Granger","dob":"?","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/care_insane_ab_librivox","sections":[{"id":"76227","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Note to the Second Edition and Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"471","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76228","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapter I","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"607","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76229","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Chapter II","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"659","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76230","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Chapter III","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"955","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76231","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Chapter IV","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1225","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76232","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Chapter V","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1316","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76233","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Chapter VI","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"848","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76234","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Chapter VII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"794","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76235","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Chapter VIII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1257","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76236","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Chapter IX","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1492","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]},{"id":"76237","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Chapter X","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1273","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3681","display_name":"Ann Boulais"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"94","name":"Medical"},{"id":"100","name":"Psychology"}],"translators":[]}}}
