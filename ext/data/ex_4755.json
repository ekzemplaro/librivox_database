In other words, \u201cpoor thing, she\u2019s blind, isn\u2019t it awful?\u201d Ha! Lucilla Finch is the wisest of all the characters, in spite of, and perhaps because of, her blindness. This story is about her trials, tribulations and triumphs. She reminds me of myself. Not the falling recklessly in love and being pulled this way and that by foolish young men and mad old doctors. I mean that, like her, I\u2019m blind and proud of it!\n(Introduction by Sandra G)<br \/><br \/>\nEditing by TriciaG & Nadine Eckert-Boulet <br \/><br \/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/3632","language":"English","copyright_year":"1872","num_sections":"51","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4755","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/poor_miss_finch_sg_librivox\/poor_miss_finch_sg_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poor_Miss_Finch","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/poor-miss-finch-by-wilkie-collins\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"20:05:30","totaltimesecs":72330,"authors":[{"id":"326","first_name":"Wilkie","last_name":"Collins","dob":"1824","dod":"1889"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/poor_miss_finch_sg_librivox","sections":[{"id":"47074","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
