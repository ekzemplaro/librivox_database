{"books":{"4":{"id":"2603","title":"Damn! A Book of Calumny","description":"<p> Henry Louis \"H. L.\" Mencken (1880 \u2013 1956) was an American journalist, essayist, magazine editor, satirist, acerbic critic of American life and culture, and a student of American English. Known as the \"Sage of Baltimore\", he is regarded as one of the most influential American writers and prose stylists of the first half of the 20th century. Mencken is perhaps best remembered today for The American Language, a multi-volume study of how the English language is spoken in the United States, and for his satirical reporting on the Scopes trial, which he named the \"Monkey\" trial.\"<br \/>\n(Summary by Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/18948","language":"English","copyright_year":"1918","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2603","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/damn_0901_librivox\/damn_0901_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/damn-a-book-of-calumny-by-hl-mencken\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:26:22","totaltimesecs":8782,"authors":[{"id":"637","first_name":"H.
