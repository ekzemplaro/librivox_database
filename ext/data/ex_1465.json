And very large-sized dogs shall romp through every page! And the mercury shiver perpetually in the vicinity of zero! And every foot of earth be crusty-brown and bare with no white snow at all till the very last moment when you'd just about given up hope!

And one or two other oldish persons. But they all go away just as early in the narrative as I can manage it.\u2014Are obliged to go away!<br><\/br> Yet lest you find in this general combination of circumstances some sinister threat of audacity, let me conventionalize the story at once by opening it at that most conventional of all conventional Christmas-story hours,\u2014the Twilight of Christmas Eve.\" (excerpt from the text)<\/p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/20213","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1465","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/good_will_to_dogs_ah_librivox\/good_will_to_dogs_ah_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/peace-on-earth-good-will-to-dogs-by-eleanor-hallowell-abbott\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:53:05","totaltimesecs":6785,"authors":[{"id":"1628","first_name":"Eleanor Hallowell","last_name":"Abbott","dob":"1872","dod":"1958"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/good_will_to_dogs_ah_librivox","sections":[{"id":"145528","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2603","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1901","display_name":"Allyson Hester"}]},{"id":"145529","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2047","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1901","display_name":"Allyson Hester"}]},{"id":"145530","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2135","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1901","display_name":"Allyson Hester"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"77","name":"Animals"},{"id":"88","name":"House & Home"}],"translators":[]}}}
