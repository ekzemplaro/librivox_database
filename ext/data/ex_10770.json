{"books":{"4":{"id":"10770","title":"Thin Ghost And Others","description":" Five ghost stories, published in 1920, by the early twentieth century master of ghostery.  Montague Rhodes James (1862 \u2013 1936), who used the publication name M. R. James, was an English author, medievalist scholar and academic. Though James's work as a medievalist is still highly regarded, he is best remembered for his ghost stories, which are regarded as among the best in the genre. James redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic clich\u00e9s of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, James's protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests. Accordingly, he is known as the originator of the \"antiquarian ghost story\". - Summary by Wikipedia and david wales","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/20387","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10770","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2959","first_name":"M.
