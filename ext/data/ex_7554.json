{"books":{"20":{"id":"7554","title":"Three Impostors","description":"Three friends in a large old dilapidated house are laughing. They seem as giddy as an acting troupe at closing night. But their laughter is callous, cruel; you might say, evil. One of them, a young woman described as piquant rather than beautiful with eyes of a shining hazel, carries a neatly wrapped parcel. She says it is for the doctor's museum. It is dripping. Do you want to know why? Then, listen! There's more than one tale told, but what is the truth? My dears, are you sure you want to know?\n\nSummary by Tony Oliva and put in the public domain.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/TheThreeImposters","language":"English","copyright_year":"1895","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7554","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/three_imposters_to_librivox\/three_imposters_to_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Three_Impostors","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-three-impostors-by-arthur-machen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:29:49","totaltimesecs":23389,"authors":[{"id":"2155","first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"Machen","dob":"1863","dod":"1947"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/three_imposters_to_librivox","sections":[{"id":"116470","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Prologue","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"490","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6671","display_name":"Tony Oliva"}]},{"id":"116471","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Adventure of the Gold Tiberius","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1285","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6671","display_name":"Tony Oliva"}]},{"id":"116472","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Encounter of the Pavement","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"644","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6671","display_name":"Tony Oliva"}]},{"id":"116473","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Novel of the Dark Valley;
