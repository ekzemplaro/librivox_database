In short, we began to tell ghost stories; and although some of the party professed an utter disbelief in apparitions, they proved to be as fertile as the believers in their contributions\u2014relating something that had happened to themselves or their friends, as having undoubtedly occurred, or to all appearance, occurred\u2014only, with the reservation, that it must certainly have been a dream. The substance of these conversations fills the following pages, and I have told the stories as nearly as possible in the words of the original narrators.\" ( Author's Preface and david wales)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/39485","language":"English","copyright_year":"1859","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10880","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/ghosts_and_family_legends_a_volume_for_christmas_1606_librivox\/ghosts_and_family_legends_a_volume_for_christmas_1606_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/ghosts-and-family-legends-a-volume-for-christmas-by-catherine-crowe\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"06:46:51","totaltimesecs":24411,"authors":[{"id":"12029","first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"Crowe","dob":"1803","dod":"1876"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ghosts_and_family_legends_a_volume_for_christmas_1606_librivox","sections":[{"id":"370547","section_number":"0","title":"Preface: Round The Fire","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/ghostsfamilylegends_00_crowe_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"225","file_name":"ghostsfamilylegends_00_crowe_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"370548","section_number":"1","title":"Round The Fire: First Evening (The Lover's Farewell;
