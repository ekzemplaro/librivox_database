{"books":{"46":{"id":"8512","title":"Junior Classics Volume 7: Stories of Courage and Heroism","description":"The stories in this volume are true stories, and have been arranged in chronological order, an arrangement that will aid the reader to remember the times to which the stories relate.\n\nAlmost any encyclopedia can be consulted for general details of the life stories of the interesting people whose names crowd the volume except perhaps in the cases of Peter Williamson and John Tanner, \"The True Story of a Kidnapped Boy,\" and \"A White Boy Among the Indians.\" Peter Williamson was kidnapped in Glasgow, Scotland, when he was eight years old, was captured by the Cherokee Indians in 1745, and (though the story does not tell this) he returned to England and became a prominent citizen. He first made the British Government pay damages for his kidnapping, gave the first exhibition in England of Indian war dances, and was the first Englishman to publish a street directory. He was finally pensioned by the Government for his services in establishing a penny post.\n\nJohn Tanner, the son of a clergyman, was stolen by the Indians some years later. His mother died when he was very young, his father treated him harshly, and so when the Indians kidnapped him he made no effort to escape. John remained among them until he was an old man, and the story of his life, which he was obliged to dictate to others as he could neither read nor write, was first published about 1830. The stories of these boys are considered to be two of the most reliable early accounts we possess of life among the Indians. - Summary by the author<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/6302","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"47","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8512","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/juniorclassicsvol7storiescourage_1501_librivox\/juniorclassicsvol7storiescourage_1501_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-junior-classics-volume-7-stories-of-courage-and-heroism-by-william-patten\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"14:43:13","totaltimesecs":52993,"authors":[{"id":"4106","first_name":" William","last_name":"Patten","dob":"1866","dod":"1945"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/juniorclassicsvol7storiescourage_1501_librivox","sections":[{"id":"301625","section_number":"1","title":"How Phidias Helped the Image-Maker by Beatrice Harraden","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/juniorclassicsvolume7_01_patten.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"571","file_name":"juniorclassics_7_01_patten_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9004","display_name":"Greg Laughland"}]},{"id":"301626","section_number":"2","title":"The Fight at the Pass of Thermopyl\u00e6 - by Charlotte M.
