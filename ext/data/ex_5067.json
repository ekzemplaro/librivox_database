{"books":{"7":{"id":"5067","title":"Journal of Submarine Commander Von Forstner","description":"<p>The Journal of Submarine Commander Von Forstner is a graphic account of WWI submarine warfare. Forstner was the commander of German U-boat U-28. His journal, first published 1916, gives a gritty picture of daily life inside a submarine and details several torpedo attacks on Allied shipping. The 1917 translation of Forstner\u2019s journal into English was unquestionably intended to bolster the Allied war effort. In the foreword, the translator states: \u201cNothing at the present day has aroused such fear as this invisible enemy, nor has anything outraged the civilized world like the tragedies caused by the German submarines.\u201d\n\nThis audio read of Forstner\u2019s journal was prompted by a tour of a captured WWII German U-505 submarine, which is a prime draw at Chicago\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry. The sub\u2019s interior is not for claustrophobics--a hunkered maze of pipes and valves, banks of engines and batteries that leave very little room for humans. Particularly arresting are the sleeping quarters--bunks cozy\u2019d up with the 15 foot long torpedoes.\n\n(Introduction by Sue Anderson)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30114","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5067","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/journal_submarine_commander_1101_librivox\/journal_submarine_commander_1101_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-journal-of-submarine-commander-von-forstner-by-george-gunther-freiherr-von-forstner\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:47:28","totaltimesecs":10048,"authors":[{"id":"1661","first_name":"George-G\u00fcnther von","last_name":"Forstner","dob":"1882","dod":"1940"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/journal_submarine_commander_1101_librivox","sections":[{"id":"54719","section_number":"0","title":"Foreward","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"252","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"54720","section_number":"1","title":"Introductory Essay, Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1101","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"54721","section_number":"2","title":"Introductory Essay, Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1304","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"54722","section_number":"3","title":"The Journal, Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1623","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"54723","section_number":"4","title":"The Journal, Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1549","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"54724","section_number":"5","title":"The Journal, Part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1636","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"54725","section_number":"6","title":"The Journal, Part 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1720","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"54726","section_number":"7","title":"The Journal, Part 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"863","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"111","name":"Memoirs"}],"translators":[]}}}
