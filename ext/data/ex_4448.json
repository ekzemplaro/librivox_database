{"books":{"16":{"id":"4448","title":"Prior Analytics","description":"<p><i>Prior Analytics<\/i> is the third of Aristotle's six texts on logic which are collectively known as the Organon (\"Instrument\"). In <i>Prior Analytics<\/i> Aristotle conducts a formal study of arguments. In logic an argument is a series of true or false statements which lead to a true or false conclusion. Aristotle identifies valid and invalid forms of arguments called <i>syllogisms<\/i>. A syllogism is an argument consisting of three sentences: two premises and a conclusion. Of the entire Aristotelian corpus, Aristotle gives priority to the study of his treatises on Logic.
