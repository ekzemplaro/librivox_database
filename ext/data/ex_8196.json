{"books":{"31":{"id":"8196","title":"Adventures of the Teenie Weenies","description":"The Teenie Weenies are people two inches tall who live under a rose bush with \"real world\" size materials made from discarded objects like hats, jars, barrels, kegs, and boxes - all of which were gigantic to them.  Each Teenie Weenie has  a unique personality that both names them and defines how they interact with the world and each other.  The General is in charge and runs the tiny village, the Cook of course is in charge of food, the Fireman, the Policeman, The Turk, the Indian, The Cowboy, the Chinese Man, Grandma, Grandpa, The Lady of Fashion and many many more have many adventures.  These stories are not long and if popular I might post more Teenie Weenie books.   - Summary by Phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.childrensbooksonline.org\/Adventures_of_the_Teenie_Weenies\/pages\/01_Adventures_of_the_Teenie_Weenies.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"32","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8196","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10094","first_name":"William","last_name":"Donahey","dob":"1883","dod":"1970"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"294240","section_number":"1","title":"The Teenie Weenies - Who They Are and Where They Live","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/adventuresoftheteenieweenies_01_donahey_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"294241","section_number":"2","title":"The Easter Egg","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/adventuresoftheteenieweenies_02_donahey_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"294242","section_number":"3","title":"The Rain Came Down By the Thimblefull","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/adventuresoftheteenieweenies_03_donahey_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"294243","section_number":"4","title":"Gogo and the Cook Run Across an Early Bird","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/adventuresoftheteenieweenies_04_donahey_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"294244","section_number":"5","title":"The Dunce Picks a Soft Place to Fall","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/adventuresoftheteenieweenies_05_donahey_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"294245","section_number":"6","title":"Help!
