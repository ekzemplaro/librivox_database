{"books":{"10":{"id":"10927","title":"Hospital Transports; A Memoir Of The Embarkation Of The Sick And Wounded From The Peninsula Of Virginia In The Summer Of 1862","description":"The United States Sanitary Commission (USSC) was a private relief agency created by federal legislation in June,  1861, to support sick and wounded soldiers of the U.S. Army during the American Civil War. It operated across the North, raised an estimated $25 million in Civil War era revenue (assuming 1865 dollars, $386.47 million in 2016) and in-kind contributions to support the cause, and enlisted thousands of volunteers.  It may be viewed as a precursor to the Red Cross.   Frederick Law Olmsted (1822 \u2013 1903) was an American landscape architect, journalist, social critic, and public administrator.  Olmsted took leave as director of New York\u2019s Central Park to work as Executive Secretary of the U.S. Sanitary Commission,  in Washington, D.C. He tended to the wounded during the American Civil War. In 1862 during Union General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, Olmsted headed the medical effort for the sick and wounded at White House in New Kent County, where there was a ship landing on the Pamunkey River. - Summary by david wales","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/52122","language":"English","copyright_year":"1863","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10927","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"12099","first_name":"Frederick Law","last_name":"Olmsted","dob":"1822","dod":"1903"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"371919","section_number":"0","title":"Dedication and Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/hospitaltransport_00_olmsted_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371920","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/hospitaltransport_01_olmsted_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371921","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371922","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371923","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371924","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371925","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371926","section_number":"7","title":"Appendix A  An Olmsted Memorandum","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371927","section_number":"8","title":"Appendix B  Regulations For Floating Hospital Service Of The Sanitary Commission For The Campaign In Virginia","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371928","section_number":"9","title":"Appendix C  Copies Of Two Letters; Memorandum Of Arrangements","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"371929","section_number":"10","title":"Appendix D  Extracts From Some Documents","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"73","name":"War & Military"},{"id":"94","name":"Medical"}],"translators":[]}}}
