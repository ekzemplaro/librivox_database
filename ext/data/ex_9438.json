{"books":{"18":{"id":"9438","title":"Bishop's Apron","description":"\"Canon Spratte saw himself as he thought others might see him: mediocre, pompous, self-assertive, verbose.\" Maugham could have added ambitious, hypocritical, and vain. In this engrossing social satire, Theodore Spratte, a cleric, motivated by an obsessive desire to be elevated to bishop, embellishes his family history and intrudes upon his son's and daughter's courtships. A reviewer in 1906 wrote, \"The whole book is an admirable blend of cynical gaiety and broadly farcical comedy; it is the smartest and most genuinely humorous novel that the season has yet given us.\" -- Lee Smalley ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/47523","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9438","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/bishops_apron_ls_1502_librivox\/bishops_apron_ls_1502_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-bishops-apron-by-w-somerset-maugham\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"06:35:01","totaltimesecs":23701,"authors":[{"id":"73","first_name":"W.
