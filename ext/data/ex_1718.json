{"books":{"23":{"id":"1718","title":"Aeneid","description":"<p>    The Aeneid is a Latin epic written by Virgil in the 1st century BC that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who traveled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. The first six of the poem\u2019s twelve books tell the story of Aeneas\u2019 wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem\u2019s second half treats the Trojans\u2019 ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The poem was commissioned from Vergil by the Emperor Augustus to glorify Rome. Several critics think that the hero Aeneas\u2019 abandonment of the Cartheginian Queen Dido, is meant as a statement of how Augustus\u2019 enemy, Mark Anthony, should have behaved with the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra.
