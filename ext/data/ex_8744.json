{"books":{"39":{"id":"8744","title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","description":"From September 12, 1884 through November 6, 1885, C.F.W. Walther delivered a series of 39 Friday evening lectures to his students at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. Unlike his doctrinal lectures during the school day, these lectures were intimate and informal. By them he intended not only to educate but to form pastors into seesorgers (healers of the soul). These lectures were first published in 1895 and have become renoun for their depth, sensitivity and insightfulness into the human heart. For well over a hundred years, generations of pastors have read and marveled at this classic presentation of Law and Gospel. - Summary by Jonathan Lange","url_text_source":"http:\/\/lutherantheology.com\/uploads\/works\/walther\/LG\/","language":"English","copyright_year":"1929","num_sections":"40","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8744","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Law_and_Gospel","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10479","first_name":"C.
