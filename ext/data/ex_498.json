{"books":{"7":{"id":"498","title":"Antichrist","description":"<p>Save for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, <i>Ecce Homo<\/i>, <i>The Antichrist<\/i> is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their final form. Of all Nietzsche\u2019s books, <i>The Antichrist<\/i> comes nearest to conventionality in form. It presents a connected argument with very few interludes, and has a beginning, a middle and an end. The reason to listen to this version is that H.L. Mencken, the famous journalist, turned Nietzsche's German into such direct, plain-spoken American English that it puts the haranguing philosopher right up in your face.<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/19322\/19322-h\/19322-h.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1895","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/498","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/antichrist_librivox_\/antichrist_librivox__64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Antichrist_(book)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-antichrist-by-nietzsche\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:57:57","totaltimesecs":14277,"authors":[{"id":"411","first_name":"Friedrich","last_name":"Nietzsche","dob":"1844","dod":"1900"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/antichrist_librivox_","sections":[{"id":"128037","section_number":"1","title":"Introduction by HL Mencken","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2366","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"100","display_name":"Judy Bieber"}]},{"id":"128038","section_number":"2","title":"Author's Preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"194","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"128","display_name":"ML Cohen"}]},{"id":"128039","section_number":"3","title":"1-19 (Christianity, Theology, Kant) ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2484","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"613","display_name":"D.E.
