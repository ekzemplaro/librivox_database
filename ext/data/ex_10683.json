{"books":{"18":{"id":"10683","title":"Inheritors","description":"The Inheritors: An Extravagant Story (1901) is a quasi-science fiction novel on which Ford Madox Ford and Joseph Conrad collaborated. It looks at society's mental evolution and what is gained and lost in the process. Written before the first World War, its themes of corruption and the effect of the 20th Century on British aristocracy appeared to predict history. In the novel, the metaphor of the \"fourth dimension\" is used to explain a societal shift from a generation of people who have traditional values of interdependence, being overtaken by a modern generation who believe in expediency, callously using political power to bring down the old order. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/14888","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10683","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Inheritors_(Conrad_and_Ford_novel)","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"95","first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Conrad","dob":"1857","dod":"1924"},{"id":"281","first_name":"Ford Madox","last_name":"Ford","dob":"1873","dod":"1939"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"363837","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lynnet\/inheritors_01_conrad_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363838","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lynnet\/inheritors_02_conrad_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363839","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/lynnet\/inheritors_03_conrad_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363840","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363841","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363842","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363843","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363844","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363845","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363846","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363847","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363848","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363849","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363850","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 14","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363851","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter 15","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363852","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter 16","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363853","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter 17","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363854","section_number":"18","title":"Chapter 16","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"363855","section_number":"19","title":"Chapter 19","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"13","name":"Fantastic Fiction"},{"id":"30","name":"Science Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
