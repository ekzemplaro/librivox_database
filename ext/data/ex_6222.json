{"books":{"7":{"id":"6222","title":"History of England, from the Accession of James II - (Volume 5, Chapter 25)","description":"This is volume 5, chapter 25 of a series of books written by the Baron Macaulay (1800-1859) and published after his death.\n\nTo quote from the preface - 'I HAVE thought it right to publish that portion of the continuation of the \"History of England\" which was fairly transcribed and revised by Lord Macaulay. It is given to the world precisely as it was left: no connecting link has been added; no reference verified; no authority sought for or examined. It would indeed have been possible, with the help I might have obtained from his friends, to have supplied much that is wanting; but I preferred, and I believe the public will prefer, that the last thoughts of the great mind passed away from among us should be preserved sacred from any touch but his own. Besides the revised manuscript, a few pages containing the first rough sketch of the last two months of William's reign are all that is left. From this I have with some difficulty deciphered the account of the death of William. No attempt has been made to join it on to the preceding part, or to supply the corrections which would have been given by the improving hand of the author. But, imperfect as it must be, I believe it will be received with pleasure and interest as a fit conclusion to the life of his great hero.'<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2614","language":"English","copyright_year":"1859","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6222","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/macaulay_vol5_chap25_1201_librivox\/macaulay_vol5_chap25_1201_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/history-of-england-from-the-accession-of-james-ii-volume-5-chapter-25-by-thomas-babington-macaulay\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:07:24","totaltimesecs":11244,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/macaulay_vol5_chap25_1201_librivox","sections":[{"id":"85765","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapter XXV, Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1660","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"85766","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Chapter XXV, Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1427","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"85767","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Chapter XXV, Part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1492","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"85768","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Chapter XXV, Part 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1457","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"85769","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Chapter XXV, Part 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1512","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"85770","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Chapter XXV, Part 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1431","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"85771","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Chapter XXV, Part 7","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1184","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"85772","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Chapter XXV, Part 8","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1081","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
