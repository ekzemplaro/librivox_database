{"books":{"24":{"id":"1187","title":"Eight Cousins","description":"This is the story of Rose, a rich but lonely and sickly girl who has been recently orphaned and sent to live with her maiden aunts. When Rose's guardian, Uncle Alec, returns from abroad he takes over her care. Through his unorthodox theories about child-rearing and her exposure to the exploits of her seven male cousins and numerous aunts, Rose becomes happier and healthier, cured of many of her fears and prejudices. She also makes friends with Phebe, her aunts' maid of her own age, whose cheerful attitude in the face of poverty helps to illustrate to Rose her own good fortune. \n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2726","language":"English","copyright_year":"1875","num_sections":"25","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1187","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/eight_cousins_c_librivox\/eight_cousins_c_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eight_Cousins","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/eight-cousins-by-louisa-may-alcott\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:15:17","totaltimesecs":26117,"authors":[{"id":"93","first_name":"Louisa May","last_name":"Alcott","dob":"1832","dod":"1888"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/eight_cousins_c_librivox","sections":[{"id":"140556","section_number":"0","title":"Preface (88 wds)","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"66","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1335","display_name":"Clarica"}]},{"id":"140557","section_number":"1","title":"Ch 1 -
