{"books":{"22":{"id":"5061","title":"Lives of the Queens of England Volume 2","description":"<p>The Lives of the Queens of England is a multi-volumed work attributed to Agnes Strickland, though it was mostly researched and written by her sister Elizabeth. These volumes give biographies of the queens of England from the Norman Conquest in 1066. Although by today's standards, it is not seen as a very scholarly work, the Stricklands used many sources that had not been used before.\n\nVolume 2 includes the biographies of Berengaria of Navarre, Isabella of Angouleme, Eleanor of Provence, Eleanora of Castille, Margarite of France, Isabella of France, Philippa of Hainault, and Anne of Bohemia.\n\n(Introduction by Ann Boulais)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/livesqueensengl05strigoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1852","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5061","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/lives_queens_england_vol2_1105_librivox\/lives_queens_england_vol2_1105_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-lives-of-the-queens-of-england-volume-2-by-agnes-strickland-elisabeth-strickland\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:23:39","totaltimesecs":37419,"authors":[{"id":"3491","first_name":"Elisabeth","last_name":"Strickland","dob":"1794","dod":"1875"},{"id":"1287","first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"Strickland","dob":"1796","dod":"1874"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/lives_queens_england_vol2_1105_librivox","sections":[{"id":"54549","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
