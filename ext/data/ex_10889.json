{"books":{"22":{"id":"10889","title":"In Indian Tents","description":"A collection of the legends and stories of North Eastern Indians \"n the summer of 1882 and 1883, I was associated with Charles G. Leland in the collection of the material for his book The Algonquin Legends of New England, published in 1884. I found the work so delightful, that I have gone on with it since, whenever I found myself in the neighborhood of Indians. The supply of legends and tales seems to be endless, one supplementing and complementing another, so that there may be a dozen versions of one tale, each containing something new. I have tried, in this little book, in every case, to bring these various versions into a single whole; though I scarcely hope to give my readers the pleasure which I found in hearing them from the Indian story-tellers. Only the very old men and women remember these stories now; and though they know that their legends will soon be buried with them, and forgotten, it is not easy task to induce them to repeat them. One may make half-a-dozen visits, tell his own best stories, and exert all his arts of persuasion, in vain, then stroll hopelessly by some day, to be called in to hear some marvellous bit of folklore. These old people have firm faith witches, fairies, and giants of whom they tell; and any trace of amusement or incredulity would meet with quick indignation and reserve.\" - Abby L.
