{"books":{"6":{"id":"8557","title":"Vocation of the Scholar","description":"Johann Gottlieb Fichte (German: [\u02c8jo\u02d0han \u02c8\u0261\u0254tli\u02d0p \u02c8f\u026a\u00e7t\u0259]; May 19, 1762 \u2013 January 27, 1814) was a German philosopher. He was one of the founding figures of the philosophical movement known as German idealism, which developed from the theoretical and ethical writings of Immanuel Kant. Fichte is often perceived as a figure whose philosophy forms a bridge between the ideas of Kant and those of the German Idealist Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Recently, philosophers and scholars have begun to appreciate Fichte as an important philosopher in his own right due to his original insights into the nature of self-consciousness or self-awareness. Like Descartes and Kant before him, he was motivated by the problem of subjectivity and consciousness. Fichte also wrote works of political philosophy and is considered one of the fathers of German nationalism. This book consists of an author's preface and five lectures delivered by Fichte at Jena University, Holy Roman Empire, in 1794.  - Summary by Wikipedia and Soupy","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/vocationofschol00fich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1847","num_sections":"7","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8557","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/vocationofthescholar_1405_librivox\/vocationofthescholar_1405_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-vocation-of-the-scholar-by-johann-gottlieb-fichte\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:40:22","totaltimesecs":9622,"authors":[{"id":"10347","first_name":" Johann Gottlieb","last_name":"Fichte","dob":"1762","dod":"1814"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/vocationofthescholar_1405_librivox","sections":[{"id":"302650","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction, by William Smith","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/vocationofthescholar_00_fichte_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"759","file_name":"vocationofthescholar_00_fichte_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"302644","section_number":"1","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/vocationofthescholar_01_fichte_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"326","file_name":"vocationofthescholar_01_fichte_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"302645","section_number":"2","title":"Lecture I.
