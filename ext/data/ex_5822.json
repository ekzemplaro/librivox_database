{"books":{"12":{"id":"5822","title":"Ultimate Weapon","description":"The star Mira was unpredictably variable. Sometimes it was blazing, brilliant and hot. Other times it was oddly dim, cool, shedding little warmth on its many planets. Gresth Gkae, leader of the Mirans, was seeking a better star, one to which his \"people\" could migrate. That star had to be steady, reliable, with a good planetary system. And in his astronomical searching, he found Sol.\n\nWith hundreds of ships, each larger than whole Terrestrial spaceports, and traveling faster than the speed of light, the Mirans set out to move in to Solar regions and take over.\n\nAnd on Earth there was nothing which would be capable of beating off this incredible armada\u2014until Buck Kendall stumbled upon THE ULTIMATE WEAPON.\n\n(Introduction by John W.
