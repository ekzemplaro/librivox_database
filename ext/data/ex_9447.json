{"books":{"29":{"id":"9447","title":"Selected Interviews with Robert G. Ingersoll, Volume 2","description":"A controversial lecturer and famous orator of the mid 1800's, Ingersoll railed against the absurdities of the Bible and cruelties of orthodox Christianity, tirelessly supported the arts, education, science, women\u2019s rights, abolition, home, family, children, and human liberty, whose creed was: \u201cHappiness is the only good, Reason the only torch, Justice the only worship, Humanity the only religion, and Love the only priest.\u201d He was often attacked from the pulpit and in the press. Here are 30 more published interviews (from among hundreds), in which Ingersoll spoke extemporaneously, bitingly, sometimes hilariously, on a wide range of topics, with newspaper reporters of the day.
