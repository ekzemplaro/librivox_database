{"books":{"48":{"id":"9490","title":"Ned Franks, or The Christian's Panoply","description":"Ned Franks, a on.e-armed Christian sailor, returns to his sister's home after several years away at sea.  She and her son are not Christians, and are cold toward him, viewing him as a hindrance and expense.  By his upright, kind behavior, and willingness to work, he soon begins supporting himself, and becomes well-liked in the community, especially by the children.  Various other characters face and overcome challenges, including a servant girl who breaks a habit of dishonesty, and a Jew who is faced with the reality that Jesus Christ is the Messiah.  The design of this story is unique, as each chapter demonstrates a new fruit of the Spirit, as described in Galatians 5:22-23  Excellent for children and adults of all ages. - Summary by Alayna
