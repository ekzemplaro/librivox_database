{"books":{"9":{"id":"152","title":"Beyond Good and Evil","description":"First published in 1886 at Nietzsche\u2019s own expense, the book was not initially considered important. In it, Nietzsche denounced what he considered to be the moral vacuity of 19th century thinkers. He attacked philosophers for what he considered to be their lack of critical sense and their blind acceptance of Christian premises in their considerations of morality and values. Beyond Good and Evil is a comprehensive overview of Nietzsche\u2019s mature philosophy.\n(Summary from Wikipedia)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/4363","language":"English","copyright_year":"1885","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/152","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/beyond_good_and_evil_librivox\/beyond_good_and_evil_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beyond_Good_and_Evil","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/beyond-good-and-evil-by-friedrich-nietzsche\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:02.10","totaltimesecs":482.1,"authors":[{"id":"411","first_name":"Friedrich","last_name":"Nietzsche","dob":"1844","dod":"1900"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/beyond_good_and_evil_librivox","sections":[{"id":"122940","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"362","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"78","display_name":"Hugh McGuire"}]},{"id":"122941","section_number":"1","title":"Prejudices of Philosophers","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3568","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"78","display_name":"Hugh McGuire"}]},{"id":"122942","section_number":"2","title":"The Free Spirit","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2399","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"479","display_name":"wedschild"}]},{"id":"122943","section_number":"3","title":"The Religious Mood","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2644","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"480","display_name":"Chris Vee"}]},{"id":"122944","section_number":"4","title":"Apophtegms and Interludes","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1410","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"115","display_name":"Maddie"}]},{"id":"122945","section_number":"5","title":"The Natural History of Morals","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3445","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"252","display_name":"Rainer"}]},{"id":"122946","section_number":"6","title":"We Scholars","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3215","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"122947","section_number":"7","title":"Our Virtues","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"4192","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"163","display_name":"Andrew Miller"}]},{"id":"122948","section_number":"8","title":"Peoples and Countries","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3706","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"122949","section_number":"9","title":"What is Noble?","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"3989","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"422","display_name":"President Lethe"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"}],"translators":[{"id":"6447","first_name":"Helen","last_name":"Zimmern","dob":"1846","dod":"1934"}]}}}
