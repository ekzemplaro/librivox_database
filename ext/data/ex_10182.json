{"books":{"5":{"id":"10182","title":"Puritan Twins","description":"Daniel and Nancy are 12 year old twins living near Boston in 1638, While listening to their adventures as they work and play we also understand how they lived in a new colony.Lucy Perkins wrote a series of \"Twin books\"  which are exciting stories , as well is giving us a glimpse of life in different countries and different times.  For each book, Perkins would try to interview an individual who grew up in the given country to gain an understanding of the particular customs. Later books in the series, such as The American Twins of the Revolution, supplanted history for geography as the basis of the twins' backgrounds. I hope you like listening as much as I enjoyed reading them some years go.  - Summary by Annise","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/16644","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10182","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"288","first_name":"Lucy Fitch","last_name":"Perkins","dob":"1865","dod":"1937"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"348733","section_number":"1","title":"The Pepperells and the Captain","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348734","section_number":"2","title":"Two Days","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348735","section_number":"3","title":"On Board the 'Lucy Ann'","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348736","section_number":"4","title":"A Forest Trail","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348737","section_number":"5","title":"The New Home","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348738","section_number":"6","title":"Harvest Home","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"40","name":"Family"},{"id":"42","name":"Historical"}],"translators":[]}}}
