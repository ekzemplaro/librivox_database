{"books":{"22":{"id":"9026","title":"Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Scientists","description":"Elbert Hubbard describes the homes of authors, poets, social reformers and other prestigious people, reflecting on how their surroundings may have influenced them. These short essays are part biography and part pontification of Hubbard's opinion of the subject and their oeuvre.\n\nIn this volume he reflects on the lives of well known scientists. Included are Sir Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, Nicolaus Copernicus, Alexander von Humboldt, William Herschel, Charles Darwin, Ernst Haeckel, Carl Linnaeus, Thomas H. Huxley, John Tyndall, Alfred R. Wallace, and John Fiske. This is Volume 12 in a series of 14 books.  - Summary by Lucy Perry and Availle.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/19080","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9026","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"3471","first_name":"Elbert","last_name":"Hubbard","dob":"1856","dod":"1915"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"316076","section_number":"1","title":"Sir Isaac Newton, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"64","display_name":"Robin Cotter"}]},{"id":"316077","section_number":"2","title":"Sir Isaac Newton, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"64","display_name":"Robin Cotter"}]},{"id":"316078","section_number":"3","title":"Galileo, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"64","display_name":"Robin Cotter"}]},{"id":"316079","section_number":"4","title":"Galileo, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"64","display_name":"Robin Cotter"}]},{"id":"316080","section_number":"5","title":"Nicolaus Copernicus, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316081","section_number":"6","title":"Nicolaus Copernicus, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316082","section_number":"7","title":"Alexander von Humboldt, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"316083","section_number":"8","title":"Alexander von Humboldt, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"316084","section_number":"9","title":"William Herschel, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7389","display_name":"Steve C"}]},{"id":"316085","section_number":"10","title":"William Herschel, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7389","display_name":"Steve C"}]},{"id":"316086","section_number":"11","title":"Charles Darwin, Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/littlejourneys_greatscientists_11_hubbard_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"316087","section_number":"12","title":"Charles Darwin, Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/littlejourneys_greatscientists_12_hubbard_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"316088","section_number":"13","title":"Ernst Haeckel, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316089","section_number":"14","title":"Ernst Haeckel, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316090","section_number":"15","title":"Carl Linnaeus, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9415","display_name":"Phil Voelker"}]},{"id":"316091","section_number":"16","title":"Carl Linnaeus, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9415","display_name":"Phil Voelker"}]},{"id":"316092","section_number":"17","title":"Thomas Henry Huxley, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316093","section_number":"18","title":"Thomas Henry Huxley, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316094","section_number":"19","title":"John Tyndall, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316095","section_number":"20","title":"John Tyndall, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"316096","section_number":"21","title":"Alfred R.
