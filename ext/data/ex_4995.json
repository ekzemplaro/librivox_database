This was the Weekly Poetry project for December 5th, 2010.<br><br>Ball wrote his poem \"Karawane,\" which is a German poem consisting of nonsensical words. The meaning however resides in its meaninglessness, reflecting the chief principle behind Dadaism.<br><br>Dada or Dadaism is a cultural movement that began in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1922.[1] The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature\u2014poetry, art manifestoes, art theory\u2014theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Its purpose was to ridicule what its participants considered to be the meaninglessness of the modern world. In addition to being anti-war, dada was also anti-bourgeois and anarchistic in nature.(summary from Wikipedia)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.zeno.org\/Literatur\/M\/Ball,+Hugo\/Gedichte\/Ausgew\u00e4hlte+Gedichte\/Laut-+und+Klanggedichte\/Karawane","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4995","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/karawane_1012_librivox\/karawane_1012_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/karawane-by-hugo-ball\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:17:21","totaltimesecs":1041,"authors":[{"id":"1549","first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"Ball","dob":"1886","dod":"1927"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/karawane_1012_librivox","sections":[{"id":"53273","section_number":"1","title":"Karawane - Read by AC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"51","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2587","display_name":"Anne Cheng"}]},{"id":"53274","section_number":"2","title":"Karawane - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"61","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"53275","section_number":"3","title":"Karawane - Read by DRB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"59","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"53276","section_number":"4","title":"Karawane - Read by DW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2602","display_name":"Dirk Weber"}]},{"id":"53277","section_number":"5","title":"Karawane - Read by ELLI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"44","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3885","display_name":"Elli"}]},{"id":"53278","section_number":"6","title":"Karawane - Read by EZWA","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"50","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"53279","section_number":"7","title":"Karawane - Read by GHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"47","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"53280","section_number":"8","title":"Karawane - Read by HF","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"59","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5055","display_name":"Karlsson"}]},{"id":"53281","section_number":"9","title":"Karawane - Read by JCM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"53","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3470","display_name":"Jason Mills"}]},{"id":"53282","section_number":"10","title":"Karawane - Read by LLW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"61","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"53283","section_number":"11","title":"Karawane - Read by MG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"100","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"53284","section_number":"12","title":"Karawane - Read by MGT","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"54","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5421","display_name":"Maria Grazia Tundo"}]},{"id":"53285","section_number":"13","title":"Karawane - Read by NJB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"74","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1618","display_name":"Nicholas James Bridgewater"}]},{"id":"53286","section_number":"14","title":"Karawane - Read by RG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]},{"id":"53287","section_number":"15","title":"Karawane - Read by RJD","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"81","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4042","display_name":"Ryan DeRamos"}]},{"id":"53288","section_number":"16","title":"Karawane - Read by SR","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"60","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1998","display_name":"Sonja"}]},{"id":"53289","section_number":"17","title":"Karawane - Read by TG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"54","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3157","display_name":"TriciaG"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
