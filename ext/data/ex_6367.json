This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for February 12, 2012.<br><br>Whitman claimed that after years of competing for \"the usual rewards\", he determined to become a poet. He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period. As early as 1850, he began writing what would become Leaves of Grass, a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death.
