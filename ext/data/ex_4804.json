Among the mysteries revealed to Devanaguy, she is shown how the gods will shortly powerfully intervene directly in human affairs. When the princess finally re-awakens: she is awestruck by her experiences, and bursts into a spontaneous rhapsody of praise.\nThroughout her rapturous intercourse with Vishnu, Devanaguy boldly continues to desire answers to mankind's profoundest questionings:\n- is it possible for mere mortals to comprehend the divine wisdom of the gods?\n- can be it really be true that divine beings care enough for mankind to want to intervene in human affairs: to do them good?\n(Introduction by Godsend)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/divineenchantmen00neihrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1900","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4804","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/divine_enchantment_1010_librivox\/divine_enchantment_1010_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Divine_Enchantment","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-divine-enchantment-by-john-neihardt\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:32:00","totaltimesecs":5520,"authors":[{"id":"1356","first_name":"John","last_name":"Neihardt","dob":"1881","dod":"1973"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/divine_enchantment_1010_librivox","sections":[{"id":"48275","section_number":"0","title":"00 Prefatory","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"256","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48276","section_number":"1","title":"01 Prelude","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"101","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48277","section_number":"2","title":"02 Enchantment","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1166","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48278","section_number":"3","title":"03 Interlude","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"207","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48279","section_number":"4","title":"04 Birth of Brahm","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"416","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48280","section_number":"5","title":"05 Procreation","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1167","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48281","section_number":"6","title":"06 Preservation","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"672","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48282","section_number":"7","title":"07 Dissolution","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"700","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48283","section_number":"8","title":"08 Nirvana","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"296","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48284","section_number":"9","title":"09 Dissenchantment","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"294","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"48285","section_number":"10","title":"10 Postlude","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"245","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
