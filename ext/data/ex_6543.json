This was the Weekly Poetry project for April 8, 2012.<br><br>Where the Bee Sucks is a song performed by Ariel, an airy spirit, in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The Tempest has proved more popular as a subject for composers than most of Shakespeare's plays. Scholar Julie Sanders ascribes this to the \"perceived 'musicality' or lyricism\" of the play. Thomas Arne, best known for the patriotic song Rule, Britannia!, set this piece to music.
