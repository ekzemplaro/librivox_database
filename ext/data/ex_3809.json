{"books":{"6":{"id":"3809","title":"Dog of Flanders","description":"<p>\"Nello and Patrasche were left all alone in the world.\" So begins the poignant story of the two orphans who were to become inseparable companions. They were Nello, an orphaned youth, and Patrasche, the dog which he and his grandfather saved from near death one day. The tale takes place outside of Antwerp, and so popular has this story become that there is a commemorative statue of Nello and Patrasche standing in the village yet today. The story is powerful, and masterfully written by Marie Louise de la Ram\u00e9e under the pseudonym Ouida.
