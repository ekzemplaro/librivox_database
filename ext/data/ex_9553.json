{"books":{"30":{"id":"9553","title":"Some Everyday Folk and Dawn","description":"It is 1904 and women's suffrage has hit the small town of Noonoon. Though the election campaigners preen themselves for the women's vote, the fight isn't entirely won, for the male residents are bristling at this threat to their supremacy. And down at Clay's there are other problems too: Dawn is now a young woman and in these days of slender chances Grandma Clay must keep an eye on the marriage market. But Dawn, lively and outspoken wants a career on the stage. - Summary by Trove - National Library of Australia","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/21659","language":"English","copyright_year":"1909","num_sections":"30","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9553","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/trove.nla.gov.au\/work\/13693591","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"5206","first_name":" Miles","last_name":"Franklin","dob":"1879","dod":"1954"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"329671","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
