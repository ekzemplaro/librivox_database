{"books":{"30":{"id":"9553","title":"Some Everyday Folk and Dawn","description":"It is 1904 and women's suffrage has hit the small town of Noonoon. Though the election campaigners preen themselves for the women's vote, the fight isn't entirely won, for the male residents are bristling at this threat to their supremacy. And down at Clay's there are other problems too: Dawn is now a young woman and in these days of slender chances Grandma Clay must keep an eye on the marriage market. But Dawn, lively and outspoken wants a career on the stage. - Summary by Trove - National Library of Australia","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/21659","language":"English","copyright_year":"1909","num_sections":"30","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9553","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/trove.nla.gov.au\/work\/13693591","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"5206","first_name":" Miles","last_name":"Franklin","dob":"1879","dod":"1954"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"329671","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Dedication and Glossary","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_00_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329672","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Clay's","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_01_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329673","section_number":"2","title":"02 - At Clay's","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_02_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329674","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Becoming acquainted with Grandma Clay","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_03_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329675","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Dawn's ambition","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_04_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329676","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Miss Flipp's uncle","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_05_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329677","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Grandma Clay's love story","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_06_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329678","section_number":"7","title":"07 - The little town of Noonoon","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_07_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329679","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Grandma turns nurse","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_08_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329680","section_number":"9","title":"09 - The knight has a stolen view of the lady","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_09_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329681","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Provincial politics and semi-suburban dentists","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_10_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329682","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Andrew disgraces his rarin'","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_11_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329683","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Some sideplay","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/everydayfolk_12_franklin.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329684","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Various events","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329685","section_number":"14","title":"14 - The passing of the trains","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5831","display_name":"Kirsty Leishman"}]},{"id":"329686","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Alas!
