De Cleyre was especially influenced by Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft and Clarence Darrow. After the hanging of the Haymarket protesters in 1887, she became an anarchist. \"Till then I believed in the essential justice of the American law of trial by jury,\" she wrote in an autobiographical essay, \"After that I never could.\" She was known as an excellent speaker and writer \u2013 in the opinion of biographer Paul Avrich, she was \"a greater literary talent than any other American anarchist\" \u2013 and as a tireless advocate for the anarchist cause, whose \"religious zeal,\" according to Goldman, \"stamped everything she did.\" (Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/selectedworksvo00havegoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2646","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/essays_1002_librivox\/essays_1002_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/selected-essays-by-voltairine-de-cleyre\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"12:27:12","totaltimesecs":44832,"authors":[{"id":"457","first_name":"Voltairine","last_name":"de Cleyre","dob":"1866","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/essays_1002_librivox","sections":[{"id":"5878","section_number":"1","title":"The Dominant Idea","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2512","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2269","display_name":"Rhonda Federman"}]},{"id":"5879","section_number":"2","title":"Anarchism","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3004","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2269","display_name":"Rhonda Federman"}]},{"id":"5880","section_number":"3","title":"Anarchism and American Traditions","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2459","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2269","display_name":"Rhonda Federman"}]},{"id":"5881","section_number":"4","title":"Anarchism in Literature","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2482","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2269","display_name":"Rhonda Federman"}]},{"id":"5882","section_number":"5","title":"The Making of an Anarchist","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1229","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2297","display_name":"Philippa"}]},{"id":"5883","section_number":"6","title":"The 11th November 1887","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1167","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2269","display_name":"Rhonda Federman"}]},{"id":"5884","section_number":"7","title":"Crime and Punishment, part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2031","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"5885","section_number":"8","title":"Crime and Punishment, part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2094","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"5886","section_number":"9","title":"In Defense of Emma Goldman","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1882","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1361","display_name":"lukkystarr"}]},{"id":"5887","section_number":"10","title":"Direct Action","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2966","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1361","display_name":"lukkystarr"}]},{"id":"5888","section_number":"11","title":"The Paris Commune","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1249","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"5889","section_number":"12","title":"The Mexican Revolution","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2312","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1401","display_name":"Sibella Denton"}]},{"id":"5890","section_number":"13","title":"Thomas Paine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1044","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3426","display_name":"harsh365"}]},{"id":"5891","section_number":"14","title":"Dyer D.
