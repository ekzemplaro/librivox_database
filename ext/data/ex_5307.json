{"books":{"19":{"id":"5307","title":"Room with a View (version 2)","description":"The 1908 novel A Room With a View is the story of Lucy Honeychurch, a young English girl traveling to Italy for the first time.  While staying in Florence, Lucy meets the unconventional George Emerson, with whom she shares a single passionate kiss, much to the horror of her chaperone, her spinsterish cousin Charlotte.  Back in England, Lucy finds she must choose between George and her rather stuffy fiance Cecil Vyse.  Forster's wonderfully comic romance satirizes turn-of-the-century English culture (as did his other major novel of the period, Howards End).
