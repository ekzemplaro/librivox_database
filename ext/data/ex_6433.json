{"books":{"13":{"id":"6433","title":"Firelight Fairy Book","description":"One pleasant summer day, as the fairy-tale lover sat reading a book beneath the low spreading branches of an oak tree, he heard a hum of wings, and looking up startled from his book, he discovered the Fairy Goldenwand standing close by. \"Are you still seeking new fairy tales?\" said the Fairy Goldenwand. \"Yes,\" said the reader. \"Will you write them down if I tell you some really new ones?\" said the Fairy. \"Oh yes, indeed,\" said the reader. \"And I'll put them into a book;...\" \"Oh, that will be fine!\" said the Fairy Goldenwand. \"I knew you wouldn't mind my appearing so suddenly. Ever so many things have happened in Fairyland since the last books were written, and we all think it's a dreadful shame that children have n't heard about them. Just imagine boys and girls not knowing about the adventures of the Prince in Lantern Land! Shall I tell you the story?\" And that's the way the author heard about the Shepherd of Clouds, Florian, Marianna, Giles, Bobo, and all the other new friends. That you may long enjoy their adventures is the wish of the author. And so we have it on good authority that these new fairy tales come directly from the ever truthful lips of the Fairy Goldenwand. What more could anyone want?
