{"books":{"24":{"id":"8415","title":"Kokoro: Hints and Echoes of Japanese Inner Life","description":"In an introductory paragraph, Lafcadio Hearn declares his intention:  \"The papers composing this volume treat of the inner rather than of the outer life of Japan, for which reason they have been grouped under the title Kokoro (heart). Written with the above character, this word signifies also mind, in the emotional sense; spirit; courage; resolve; sentiment; affection; and inner meaning, just as we say in English, \"the heart of things.\"\"  The result is a highly eclectic collection of stories, diary entries, cultural essays, and collected traditional texts that illustrate not only the state of Japanese society in the 1890s but also the endlessly fascinating issue of the intersection of cultures as demonstrated in a Westerner's interpretations of what he observed in Japan.  As much is revealed about the Western mind as the Japanese mind whenever such an intersection occurs. - Summary by
