{"books":{"19":{"id":"9703","title":"Mrs. Mulligatawny","description":"Arthur Macy was a Nantucket boy of Quaker extraction. His name alone is evidence of this, for it is safe to say that a Macy, wherever found in the United States, is descended from that sturdy old Quaker who was one of those who bought Nantucket from the Indians, paid them fairly for it, treated them with justice, and lived on friendly terms with them. In many ways Arthur Macy showed that he was a Nantucketer and, at least by descent, a Quaker. He often used phrases peculiar to our island in the sea, and was given, in conversation at least, to similes which smacked of salt water. Almost the last time I saw him he said, \"I'm coming round soon for a good long gam.\" (Summary from the Introduction to Poems by Arthur Macy)","url_text_source":"www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/37999","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9703","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2561","first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"Macy","dob":"1842","dod":"1904"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"334319","section_number":"1","title":"Mrs. Mulligatawny - Read by CB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/mrsmulligatawny_macy_cb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9862","display_name":"Caitlin Buckley"}]},{"id":"334321","section_number":"2","title":"Mrs. Mulligatawny - Read by EZWA","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/mrsmulligatawny_macy_ezwa_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"334322","section_number":"3","title":"Mrs. Mulligatawny - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/mrsmulligatawny_macy_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"334320","section_number":"4","title":"Mrs. Mulligatawny - Read by RC","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/mrsmulligatawny_macy_rc_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9331","display_name":"Rosslyn Carlyle"}]},{"id":"334323","section_number":"5","title":"Mrs. Mulligatawny - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/mrsmulligatawny_macy_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"334324","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334325","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334326","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334327","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334328","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334329","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334330","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334331","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334332","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334333","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334334","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334335","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334336","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334337","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"334338","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"63","name":"Single author"},{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
