{"books":{"25":{"id":"10447","title":"Canadian Fairy Tales","description":"Professor Macmillan has placed all lovers of fairy tales under a deep debt of obligation to him. The fairy tale makes a universal appeal both to old and young; to the young because it is the natural world in which their fancy delights to range, and to the old because they are conscious again of the spirit of youth as they read such tales to their children and grandchildren over and over again, and rejoice in the illusion that after all there is not a great difference of age which separates the generations.\n\nThe fairy tale makes this universal appeal because it deals with the elemental in our natures that is the same in every age and in every race. In the Canadian Tales which Professor Macmillan has so admirably gathered from Indian sources, we find the same types of character and scenes of adventure that we do in the tales of the German forests, of Scandinavia, England or France.\n\nThere is in us all an instinctive admiration for the adventurous spirit of the fairy tale which challenges the might that is cruel and devastating, and for the good offices of the fairies which help to vindicate the cause of the noble in its conflict with the ignoble, right with wrong. - Summary by the introduction","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/36241","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10447","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/canadianfairytales_1605_librivox\/canadianfairytales_1605_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/canadian-fairy-tales-by-cyrus-macmillan\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"05:03:26","totaltimesecs":18206,"authors":[{"id":"127","first_name":"Cyrus","last_name":"Macmillan","dob":"1882","dod":"1953"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/canadianfairytales_1605_librivox","sections":[{"id":"357315","section_number":"1","title":"How Glooskap Made the Birds","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/canadianfairytales_01_macmillan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"795","file_name":"canadianfairytales_01_macmillan_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10488","display_name":"R.J.
