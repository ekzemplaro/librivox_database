{"books":{"8":{"id":"10089","title":"Poems and Songs in the Lancashire Dialect","description":"A selection of poems in the Lancashire dialect by the foremost exponent of the form. A printer by training, Edwin Waugh left his trade for secretarial work and began his literary career in 1852. His first dialect poem, 'Come whoam to thi' childer and me', was written at the Clarence Hotel, Manchester, on 10 June 1856 and published in the Manchester Examiner the following day. The best known Lancashire dialect poem of its day, it inspired numerous followers whose dialect poetry and prose provided an often nostalgic accompaniment to the sound and fury of the industrial revolution. This selection of dialect poems was published shortly after Waugh's death alongside a selection of his standard English poetry. It consists of the poems that editor George Milner judged to be presentable and is accompanied by a critical introduction and commentary on Waugh's use of the Rochdale variety of the Lancashire dialect. - Summary by Phil Benson","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/poemssongs00waug","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10089","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/poems_songs_lancashire_dialect_1508_librivox\/poems_songs_lancashire_dialect_1508_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/poems-and-songs-in-the-lancashire-dialect-by-edwin-waugh\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:45:11","totaltimesecs":6311,"authors":[{"id":"9533","first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"Waugh","dob":"1817","dod":"1890"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/poems_songs_lancashire_dialect_1508_librivox","sections":[{"id":"346342","section_number":"1","title":"Come whoam to thy childer an' me; What ails thee, my son Robin?; The grindlestone; God bless these poor folk; Come, Mary link thi arm in mine","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_01_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"777","file_name":"poemsdialect_01_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346343","section_number":"2","title":"Chirrup; The dule's i' this bonnet o' mine; Willy-ground; A bit of a sing; Tommy Pobs; Toddlin' whoam","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_02_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"735","file_name":"poemsdialect_02_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346344","section_number":"3","title":"Th' sweetheart gate; Owd Enoch; Eawr folk; Forgive one another; Buckle to","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_03_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"722","file_name":"poemsdialect_03_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346345","section_number":"4","title":"Neet fo'; A lift on the way; Yesterneet; I've worn my bits o' shoon away; Gentle Jone","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_04_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"770","file_name":"poemsdialect_04_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346346","section_number":"5","title":"Tum Rindle; Bonny Nan; Tickle times; Jamie's frolic; Owd Pinder","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_05_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"655","file_name":"poemsdialect_05_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346347","section_number":"6","title":"Th' goblin parson; Come, Jamie, let's undo thi shoon; While takin' a wift o' my pipe; God bless thi silver yure; Margit's comin'","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_06_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"708","file_name":"poemsdialect_06_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346348","section_number":"7","title":"Hard weather; Come, limber lads; The garland; These bonny bits o' childer; To my old fiddle; It's time to be joggin' away","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_07_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"786","file_name":"poemsdialect_07_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346349","section_number":"8","title":"Little cattle, little care; Cradle song; The little doffer; Heigh, lads, heigh; Toothsome advice; Cock Robin","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_08_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"648","file_name":"poemsdialect_08_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]},{"id":"346350","section_number":"9","title":"Owd Roddle; My Gronfaither Willie; Come to your porritch; Heigh, Jone, owd brid","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/poemsdialect_09_waugh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"510","file_name":"poemsdialect_09_waugh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6097","display_name":"Phil Benson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
