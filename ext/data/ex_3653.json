{"books":{"2":{"id":"3653","title":"Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson","description":"<p>This is the story of Mary Rowlandson\u2019s capture by American Indians in 1675. It is a blunt, frightening, and detailed work with several moments of off-color humor. Mary, the wife of a minister, was captured by Natives during King Philip's War while living in a Lancaster town, most of which was decimated, and the people murdered. See through her eyes, which depict Indians as the instruments of Satan. Her accounts were a best-seller of the era, and a seminal work, being one of the first captivity narratives ever published by a woman. Without works such as hers, there would likely not be many modern works inspired by similar themes, such as The Searchers, starring John Wayne.(Summary by Matthew Scott Surprenant )<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/851","language":"English","copyright_year":"1682","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3653","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox\/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-narrative-of-the-captivity-and-restoration-of-mrs-mary-rowlandson-by-mary-rowlandson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:52:11","totaltimesecs":6731,"authors":[{"id":"158","first_name":"Mary White","last_name":"Rowlandson","dob":"1637","dod":"1711"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox","sections":[{"id":"16882","section_number":"1","title":"01 - part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1840","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4406","display_name":"Matthew Scott Surprenant"}]},{"id":"16883","section_number":"2","title":"02 - part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2327","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4406","display_name":"Matthew Scott Surprenant"}]},{"id":"16884","section_number":"3","title":"03 - part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2564","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4406","display_name":"Matthew Scott Surprenant"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
