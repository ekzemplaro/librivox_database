{"books":{"10":{"id":"5751","title":"History of England, from the Accession of James II - (Volume 4, Chapter 19)","description":"This is volume 4 chapter 19 of a series of books written by the Baron Macaulay (1800-1859) in the 19th century. It starts with a brief resume of the history of England up until the Stuart kings and then starts to delve into a little more detail. Macaulay is primarily fascinated by ending of any claim to divine right of kings and the growing role of Parliament in the governing of the country. He sees the accession of William and Mary (Dutch, Protestant royalty) to the British throne as a key moment in the history of the British Isles. This is a book delightful for the literary gifts of the author and intriguing for his view of 18th century English and world politics.\n(Jim Mowatt)\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2613","language":"English","copyright_year":"1870","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5751","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/macaulay_vol4_chap19_1110\/macaulay_vol4_chap19_1110_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-history-of-england-from-the-accession-of-james-iivol-4-ch-19-by-thomas-babington-macaulay\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:18:20","totaltimesecs":15500,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/macaulay_vol4_chap19_1110&re;","sections":[{"id":"72577","section_number":"1","title":"01 -Chapter XIX, Section 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1234","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6512","display_name":"mcgovern1934"}]},{"id":"72578","section_number":"2","title":"02 -Chapter XIX, Section 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1115","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"72579","section_number":"3","title":"03 -Chapter XIX, Section 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"989","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"72580","section_number":"4","title":"04 -Chapter XIX, Section 04","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1081","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"72581","section_number":"5","title":"05 -Chapter XIX, Section 05","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1430","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"72582","section_number":"6","title":"06 -Chapter XIX, Section 06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3223","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"72583","section_number":"7","title":"07 -Chapter XIX, Section 07","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1271","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6512","display_name":"mcgovern1934"}]},{"id":"72584","section_number":"8","title":"08 -Chapter XIX, Section 08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1305","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6512","display_name":"mcgovern1934"}]},{"id":"72585","section_number":"9","title":"09 -Chapter XIX, Section 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1389","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6492","display_name":"Hugh Gillis"}]},{"id":"72586","section_number":"10","title":"10 -Chapter XIX, Section 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1132","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6006","display_name":"Stephanie Lee"}]},{"id":"72587","section_number":"11","title":"11 -Chapter XIX, Section 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1331","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
