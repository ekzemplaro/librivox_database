But now, on the eve of graduation, she couldn\u2019t go on with the mask of artificiality and the air of perfection.  She had been chasing this nursing job three whole years, but there was just no wag to it!  The Superintendent was stunned.  Her best student!  The Senior Surgeon was all grey granite business and livid that his time was being taken up with a hysterical nurse!
