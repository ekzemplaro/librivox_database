{"books":{"49":{"id":"2168","title":"Bible (TCNT) NT 01-27: The New Testament","description":"<p>Published in 1904, The Twentieth Century New Testament is considered the first translation of the Bible into modern English. It was produced in Britain over a period of 15 years by approximately 20 people -- ministers, housewives, school teachers and businessmen -- who were united by their desire for a New Testament in the language of the people. They were advised by such scholars as J. Rendel Harris and Richard Weymouth so their rendering is quite accurate. In addition they made some effort at rearranging the New Testament books in the order scholars believe they were written -- Mark comes before Matthew, for instance. They also include brief introductions before each book. Though little-known today, the reader will find in The Twentieth Century New Testament a delightful translation that is rewarding both for in-depth study and personal reading.
