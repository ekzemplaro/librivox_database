{"books":{"17":{"id":"78","title":"Foolish Dictionary","description":"\"The Foolish Dictionary\" was written by \"Gideon Wurdz\" (the pen name for Charles Wayland Towne) and was published in 1904. According to the beginning of the book, it is \"An exhausting work of reference to un-certain English words, their origin, meaning, legitimate and illegitimate use...\" \n\nThis a a short but amusing dictionary which \"redefines\" words in some interesting ways. Funny and sometimes bizarre observations are sprinkled throughout. In keeping with LibriVox policy to read, rather than attempt to rewrite, books - even those with offensive content - nothing has been omitted. While many of the definitions may just seem confusing or \"corny\" to modern readers, there are a couple that also might be considered \"objectionable,\" particularly in section 10, which contains offensive content of a racial nature. \n\nSummary by Maddie<p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1989","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/78","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/foolish_dictionary_librivox\/foolish_dictionary_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-foolish-dictionary-by-gideon-wurdz\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:45:27","totaltimesecs":6327,"authors":[{"id":"4101","first_name":"Charles Wayland","last_name":"Towne","dob":"1875","dod":"1965"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/foolish_dictionary_librivox","sections":[{"id":"121720","section_number":"1","title":"Preface and Letter A","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"412","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"115","display_name":"Maddie"}]},{"id":"121721","section_number":"2","title":"Letter B","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"390","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"118","display_name":"Alex Buie"}]},{"id":"121722","section_number":"3","title":"Letter C","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"302","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"119","display_name":"Alex Patterson"}]},{"id":"121723","section_number":"4","title":"Letter D","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"268","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"119","display_name":"Alex Patterson"}]},{"id":"121724","section_number":"5","title":"Letter E","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"228","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"120","display_name":"donnie"}]},{"id":"121725","section_number":"6","title":"Letter F and G","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"457","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"120","display_name":"donnie"}]},{"id":"121726","section_number":"7","title":"Letter H","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"400","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"121","display_name":"Nikolle Doolin"}]},{"id":"121727","section_number":"8","title":"Letter I and J","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"408","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"112","display_name":"Christiane Levesque"}]},{"id":"121728","section_number":"9","title":"Letter K and L","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"486","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"83","display_name":"Catharine Eastman"}]},{"id":"121729","section_number":"10","title":"Letter M and N","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"418","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"122","display_name":"J.C."}]},{"id":"121730","section_number":"11","title":"Letter O and P","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"499","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"122","display_name":"J.C."}]},{"id":"121731","section_number":"12","title":"Letter Q and R","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"335","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"45","display_name":"Kelly Bescherer"}]},{"id":"121732","section_number":"13","title":"Letter S","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"272","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"45","display_name":"Kelly Bescherer"}]},{"id":"121733","section_number":"14","title":"Letter T","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"192","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"122","display_name":"J.C."}]},{"id":"121734","section_number":"15","title":"Letter U - Z","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"370","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"122","display_name":"J.C."}]},{"id":"121735","section_number":"16","title":"Postage and Postal Information","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"180","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"28","display_name":"Kristin Hughes"}]},{"id":"121736","section_number":"17","title":"A Few Mythological and Classical Names","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"366","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"26","display_name":"Denny Sayers"}]},{"id":"121737","section_number":"18","title":"Legal and Local Holidays in the United States","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"344","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"26","display_name":"Denny Sayers"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
