{"books":{"13":{"id":"5790","title":"His Family","description":"The 1910s is historically considered the decade of greatest social change in history. It saw the advent and proliferation of the automobile, electricity, lighting, radio, telephone and cinema. Our present time of change is actually quite tame in comparison, though also breathless. <i>His Family<\/i> is a tale of a widowed father, working to manage this decade of change as it affects his family in New York City. <i>His Family<\/i> was the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1919.
