{"books":{"23":{"id":"8719","title":"Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation","description":"Greece-born Lafcadio Hearn spent decades of his life in Japan, even marrying a Japanese woman, thus becoming a Japanese citizen by the name of Koizumi Yakumo (\u5c0f\u6cc9 \u516b\u96f2). He wrote many books on Japan, especially about its folklore. In this posthumously published book, he takes a closer look at Japan's religious history. How it developed from ancient beliefs into Shintoism, resisted suppression attempts by Buddhism and Christianity and how \u2013 despite efforts of westernizing Japan during the era known as Meiji Restoration \u2013 it remained the basis for Japanese society. Even today, over 100 years after this book was written, some of the described traditions and fundamental ideas still exist.
