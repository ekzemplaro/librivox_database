{"books":{"17":{"id":"727","title":"Souls of Black Folk","description":"<p><i>The Souls of Black Folk<\/i> is a well-known work of African-American literature by activist W.E.B. Du Bois. The book, published in 1903, contains several essays on race, some of which had been previously published in <i>Atlantic Monthly<\/i> magazine. Du Bois drew from his own experiences to develop this groundbreaking work on being African-American in American society. Outside of its notable place in African-American history, <i>The Souls of Black Folk<\/i> also holds an important place in social science as one of the first works to deal with sociology.
