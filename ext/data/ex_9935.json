By then he was already winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature (the first writer in English to be so honoured). He published his observations in articles in England in the Daily Telegraph, and in the New York Sun. At that stage of the war nationalistic sentiments were running high but the true cost of war was beginning to be understood \"at home.\" Thus Kipling's account (not least in view of his reputation today as a supporter of British imperialism and jingoism) is still interesting one hundred years later as we try to understand our ancestors' experience.
