This was the Weekly Poetry project for August 26, 2012.<br><br>Born on Long Island, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and \u2013 in addition to publishing his poetry \u2013 was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of Grass, was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. He died at age 72 and his funeral became a public spectacle.
