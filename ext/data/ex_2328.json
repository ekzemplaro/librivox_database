{"books":{"11":{"id":"2328","title":"Wood Beyond the World","description":"<p><i>The Wood beyond the World<\/i> is a fantasy novel by William Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy writer to unite an imaginary world with the element of the supernatural, and thus the precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature. His use of archaic language has been seen by some modern readers as making his fiction difficult to read, but brings a wonderful atmosphere to the telling.<br \/><br \/>Morris considered his fantasies a revival of the medieval tradition of chivalrous romances. In consequence, they tend to have sprawling plots of strung-together adventures. In this story, Walter leaves his father and his own unfaithful wife and sets sail in search of adventure.  This he finds aplenty, encountering love, treachery and magic in the Wood of the title and in travelling through the Mountains of the Folk of the Bears. But can he find happiness and peace by means of his Quest?<br \/><br \/>Read by Cori Samuel.  Edited by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wisemandarine.com\/\">Mandarine<\/a>.
