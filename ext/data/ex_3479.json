{"books":{"6":{"id":"3479","title":"Alice in Blunderland: an Iridescent Dream (version 2)","description":"<p>John Kendrick Bangs was an American author and satirist, and the creator of modern Bangasian Fantasy, the school of fantasy writing that sets the plot wholly or partially in the afterlife. (Wikipedia)<br\/><br\/>\nPlot summary: J K Bangs has taken Alice from Lewis Carroll's \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d and  lets her on a boring day travel with the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the other of Carroll's familiar characters to Blunderland. The story is a well written Satire, a witty, humorous tale of adventure and city politics, a tale of Alice in a land where nothing is as it should be.
