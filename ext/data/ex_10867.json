He was an atheist and pacifist and socialist, a botanist and zoologist and optimist, a chemist and physicist, a scientist of scientists, a monist, meliorist and hedonist\u2026\".  As a novelist, he is noted as a pioneer in both the detective and science fiction genres. He was born in Canada but spent the latter part of his life in England. <br><br>\"Biographies of Working Men\" is a volume containing brief biographies of seven men from working class backgrounds who went on to excel in their chosen fields. They are: Thomas Telford, George Stephenson, John Gibson, William Herschel, Jean Fran\u00e7ois Millet,  James Garfield and Thomas Edward.\n - Summary by Noel Badrian","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/biographiesofwor00alleuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1884","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10867","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/biographies_1606_librivox\/biographies_1606_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/biographies-of-working-men-by-grant-allen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"05:51:31","totaltimesecs":21091,"authors":[{"id":"285","first_name":"Grant","last_name":"Allen","dob":"1848","dod":"1899"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/biographies_1606_librivox","sections":[{"id":"369927","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
