in memory of these it is that I take up the pen to run the gauntlet of a thousand critical eyes on a way fraught with difficulties.\" ~ Kate John Finzi","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/45542","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8890","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10570","first_name":"Kate John","last_name":"Finzi","dob":"?","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"311750","section_number":"0","title":"Forward and Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/eighteenmonths_00_finzi_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311751","section_number":"1","title":"October, 1914","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/eighteenmonths_01_finzi_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311753","section_number":"2","title":"November, 1914","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/eighteenmonths_02_finzi_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311754","section_number":"3","title":"December, 1914","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/eighteenmonths_03_finzi_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311755","section_number":"4","title":"January, 1915","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/eighteenmonths_04_finzi_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311756","section_number":"5","title":"February, 1915","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/eighteenmonths_05_finzi_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311757","section_number":"6","title":"March, 1915","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/eighteenmonths_06_finzi_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311758","section_number":"7","title":"April, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311759","section_number":"8","title":"May, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311760","section_number":"9","title":"June, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311761","section_number":"10","title":"July, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311762","section_number":"11","title":"August, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311763","section_number":"12","title":"September, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311764","section_number":"13","title":"October, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311765","section_number":"14","title":"November, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311766","section_number":"15","title":"December, 1915","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311767","section_number":"16","title":"January, 1916","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311768","section_number":"17","title":"February, 1916","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"311769","section_number":"18","title":"Epilogue","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"73","name":"War & Military"},{"id":"111","name":"Memoirs"}],"translators":[]}}}
