{"books":{"26":{"id":"4900","title":"Bladys of the Stewponey","description":"The setting, geography and history of this story by Rev'd Sabine Baring-Gould, author of <i>Onward Christian Soldiers<\/i> and a number of other well-known hymns, are all accurate, or at least as accurate as local lore will allow. Kinver has long been a midlands beauty spot, and the UK National Trust own and open one of the rock-dwellings mentioned. The 'Stewponey' too was an inn until a year or two into the twenty-first century: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk\/News\/Reminder-of-the-heyday-of-the-old-Stewponey-2.htm\">http:\/\/www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk\/News\/Reminder-of-the-heyday-of-the-old-Stewponey-2.htm<\/a> - the present reader having stopped there for a drink and a meal many times.<br\/><br\/>\nThe story, whether you call it a romance, a historical novel or a horror story - comprising as it does a young woman being offered as a prize in a bowling match, a wife-burning, highwaymen and buried treasure - is of course wholly fiction.
