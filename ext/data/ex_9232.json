{"books":{"13":{"id":"9232","title":"Story of the Amulet","description":"The third of the series featuring Cyril, Anthea, Robert and Jane: four children who are, as they often say, \"the sort of people that wonderful things happen to\". In 'Five Children and It' they were lucky enough to meet the magical, wish-granting Psammead - and in this final book they meet him once again. He guides them to an ancient Amulet that will help them find their hearts' desire - but it's only half an amulet, and seeking for the other half has them whizzing about through time on another series of amazing adventures. - Summary by Helen Taylor","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/837","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9232","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"24","first_name":"E.","last_name":"Nesbit","dob":"1858","dod":"1924"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"321410","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1: The Psammead","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_01_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321411","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2: The Half Amulet","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_02_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321412","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3: The Past","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_03_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321413","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4: Eight Thousand Years Ago","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_04_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321414","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5: The Fight in the Village","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_05_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321415","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6: The Way to Babylon","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_06_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321416","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7: The Deepest Dungeon Below the Castle Moat","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_07_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321417","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8: The Queen in London","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_08_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321418","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9: Atlantis","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_09_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321419","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10: The Little Black Girl and Julius Caesar","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_10_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321420","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11: Before Pharaoh","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_11_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321421","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12: The Sorry-Present and the Expelled Little Boy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_12_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321422","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13: The Shipwreck on the Tin Islands","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_13_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]},{"id":"321423","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 14: The Heart's Desire","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/storyoftheamulet_14_nesbit.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9136","display_name":"Helen Taylor"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
