It is part of a series of Self-Taught books written by various authors that include vocabularies of common words, elementary grammars and conversational phrases. The present volume contains thirty-seven vocabularies of common Esperanto words. If you want to learn Esperanto words or improve your Esperanto vocabulary, this volume may be of use to you. Mann writes, in the preface, that his work \u201csupplies very full and comprehensive vocabularies of the words required by the tourist or traveller, visitor or resident abroad, health or pleasure seeker, and professional or business man, together with a large number of conversational sentences of a typical and practical character. The words and phrases are classified according to subject, and the phonetic pronunciation of every word is added in accordance with Marlborough's simple and popular system of phonetics. With the aid of this book anyone may undertake a trip to a foreign land, even if he know nothing of the language of the country he is going to, and, if he will put himself beforehand in communication with Esperantists in the various places he intends to visit, he will find them ready to help him in many ways, and his stay abroad will thus be made much more entertaining and instructive than if he had spent his time in the conventional manner of the ordinary tourist. A further great advantage of this international language is, that it opens up to the traveller, not merely one particular country, but the whole of Europe.\u201d<BR><BR>(Summary by Nicholas James Bridgewater)<BR>For convenience, his book has been divided into 3 volumes in this audiobook version, the other 2 volumes will be recorded in the future.<\/P> ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/23984","language":"Esperanto","copyright_year":"1908","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3934","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/esperanto_selftaught_1005_librivox\/esperanto_selftaught_1005_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/esperanto-self-taught-with-phonetic-pronunciation-volume-1-by-mann-william-w","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:27:49","totaltimesecs":26869,"authors":[{"id":"800","first_name":"William W.","last_name":"Mann","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/esperanto_selftaught_1005_librivox","sections":[{"id":"24697","section_number":"0","title":"00 \u2013 Preface ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"256","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1618","display_name":"Nicholas James Bridgewater"}]},{"id":"24698","section_number":"1","title":" 01 \u2013 The Esperanto Alphabet (with Phonetic Pronunciation) ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"599","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1618","display_name":"Nicholas James Bridgewater"}]},{"id":"24699","section_number":"2","title":"02 \u2013 Preliminary Notes, Letter from Dr. Zamenhof (Founder of Esperanto.)
