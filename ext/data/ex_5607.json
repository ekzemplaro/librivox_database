{"books":{"16":{"id":"5607","title":"Bruised Reed","description":"Richard Sibbes was a Puritan pastor and theologian in the 17th century. His best known work, The Bruised Reed, is based on a Scripture verse from Matt. 12:20: \"A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.\" Sibbes uses this text to respond to the despondent thoughts and fears that many Christians have. He draws a picture of Christ's gentleness and mercy for the Christians who feel themselves small and weak. The Bruised Reed is full of an amazing amount of soul-comfort. I cannot recommend it highly enough, especially to Christians struggling with depression, regret, or fear.\n\nThe publishers' foreword quotes Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones, who said:\n\n\"I shall never cease to be grateful to . . . Richard Sibbes who was balm to my soul at a period in my life when I was overworked and badly overtired, and therefore subject in an unusual manner to the onslaughts of the devil. In that state and condition . . . what you need is some gentle, tender treatment for your soul. I found at that time that Richard Sibbes, who was known in London in the early seventeenth century as 'the heavenly Doctor Sibbes', was an unfailing remedy. His books The Bruised Reed and The Soul's Conflict quietened, soothed, comforted, encouraged and healed me.\"\n\n(Introduction by rosea)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.monergism.com\/bruisedreed.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1630","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5607","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/bruised_reed_1108_librivox\/bruised_reed_1108_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-bruised-reed-by-richard-sibbes\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:20:28","totaltimesecs":15628,"authors":[{"id":"2275","first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Sibbes","dob":"1577","dod":"1635"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/bruised_reed_1108_librivox","sections":[{"id":"69571","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Publishers' Foreword","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"496","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69572","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The Reed and the Bruising","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"630","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69573","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Christ Will Not Break the Bruised Reed","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1045","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69574","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Smoking Flax","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"494","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69575","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Christ Will Not Quench the Smoking Flax","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"676","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69576","section_number":"5","title":"05 - The Spirit of Mercy Should Move Us","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1105","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69577","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Marks of the Smoking Flax","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1209","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69578","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Help for the Weak","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"969","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69579","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Duties and Discouragements","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1093","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69580","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Believe Christ, Not Satan","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"621","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69581","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Quench Not the Spirit","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1250","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69582","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Christ's Judgment and Victory","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"608","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69583","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Christ's Wise Government","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"959","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69584","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Grace Shall Reign","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1135","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69585","section_number":"14","title":"14 - Means to Make Grace Victorious","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"992","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69586","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Christ's Public Triumph","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1059","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]},{"id":"69587","section_number":"16","title":"16 - Through Conflict to Victory","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1287","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4057","display_name":"RoseA"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"128","name":"Christianity - Commentary"}],"translators":[]}}}
