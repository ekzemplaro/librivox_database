In 1852, 20 year old clergyman\u2019s daughter Ellen and her brother boarded ship for Melbourne then set off to walk to Bendigo. Dressed in her blue serge skirt which doubled as nightwear, she camped under a tent made of blankets, had mutton, damper and tea most meals and on arrival lent her hand to gold washing. And seemed to enjoy it !\nAnd amongst other things she tells of colonial life , transportation, emigration and other gold-fields.\nBut you will need to listen to hear more about bush-rangers and orphans as well as what she did with her parasol.\" (summary by annise)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4054","language":"English","copyright_year":"1853","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2327","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ladys_visit_gold_diggings_0811_librivox\/ladys_visit_gold_diggings_0811_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-ladys-visit-to-the-gold-diggings-of-australia-in-1852-53-by-ellen-clacy\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:27:52","totaltimesecs":23272,"authors":[{"id":"4875","first_name":" Ellen","last_name":"Clacy","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/ladys_visit_gold_diggings_0811_librivox","sections":[{"id":"162534","section_number":"1","title":"Introductory Remarks and the The Voyage Out","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"783","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162535","section_number":"2","title":"Stay In Melbourne","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2137","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162536","section_number":"3","title":"Camping Up - Melbourne to the Black Forest","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1686","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162537","section_number":"4","title":"Camping Up - Black Forest to Eagle Hawk Gully","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1885","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162538","section_number":"5","title":"The Diggings","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1266","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162539","section_number":"6","title":"Eagle Hawk Gully","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2321","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162540","section_number":"7","title":"An Adventure","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"675","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162541","section_number":"8","title":"Harriette Walters","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"849","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162542","section_number":"9","title":"Ironbark Gully","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1515","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162543","section_number":"10","title":"Forest Creek","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1721","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162544","section_number":"11","title":"Return to Melbourne","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1046","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162545","section_number":"12","title":"Ballarat","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1452","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162546","section_number":"13","title":"New South Wales","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"414","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162547","section_number":"14","title":"South Australia","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"669","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162548","section_number":"15","title":"Melbourne Again","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1844","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162549","section_number":"16","title":"Homeward Bound","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"528","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"162550","section_number":"17","title":"Conclusion","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"367","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"162551","section_number":"18","title":" Appendix: - Who Should Emigrate?","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2114","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"108","name":"Travel & Geography"}],"translators":[]}}}
