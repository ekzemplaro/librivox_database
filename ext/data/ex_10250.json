{"books":{"5":{"id":"10250","title":"John Gutenberg, First Master Printer: His Acts and Most Remarkable Discourses and his Death","description":"This is a brief sketch of the last years of the life of Johannes (John) Gutenberg, the man who invented the movable letter press. We join him in Mayence, where he lives in poverty. We get to know his enemies and his friends, and some information about why he isn't the rich man we'd expect him to be. This book was prepared and completed within two days by the volunteers at Distributed Proofreaders to mark their 15th birthday with the 50,000th published book at Project Gutenberg.  - Summary by Claudia Salto","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/cu31924031472438","language":"English","copyright_year":"1860","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10250","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/john_gutenberg_cs_1509_librivox\/john_gutenberg_cs_1509_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/john-gutenberg-first-master-printer-his-acts-and-most-remarkable-discourses-and-his-death-by-franz-von-dingelstedt\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:37:41","totaltimesecs":9461,"authors":[{"id":"11589","first_name":"Franz von","last_name":"Dingelstedt","dob":"1814","dod":"1881"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/john_gutenberg_cs_1509_librivox","sections":[{"id":"351299","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I.
