{"books":{"1":{"id":"7118","title":"My Buried Treasure","description":"\"This is a true story of a search for buried treasure. The only part that is not true is the name of the man with whom I searched for the treasure. Unless I keep his name out of it he will not let me write the story, and, as it was his expedition and as my share of the treasure is only what I can make by writing the story, I must write as he dictates. I think the story should be told, because our experience was unique, and might be of benefit to others. And, besides, I need the money.\" (From the text)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1761","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"2","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7118","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/buried_treasure_1210_librivox\/buried_treasure_1210_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/my-buried-treasure-by-richard-harding-davis\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:50:12","totaltimesecs":3012,"authors":[{"id":"812","first_name":"Richard Harding","last_name":"Davis","dob":"1864","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/buried_treasure_1210_librivox","sections":[{"id":"107855","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1544","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5244","display_name":"Carolin Kaiser"}]},{"id":"107856","section_number":"2","title":"Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1468","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5244","display_name":"Carolin Kaiser"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"3","name":"Action & Adventure Fiction"},{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"},{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"}],"translators":[]}}}
