Over 160 films have been made of his novels, more than any other author.\nIn the 1920s, one of Wallace's publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. \n<br>\nHe is most famous today as the co-creator of \"King Kong\", writing the early screenplay and story for the movie, as well as a short story \"King Kong\" (1933) credited to him and Draycott Dell. He was known for the J. G. Reeder detective stories, The Four Just Men, the Ringer, and for creating the Green Archer character during his lifetime.
