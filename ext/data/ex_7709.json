{"books":{"21":{"id":"7709","title":"Renegado","description":"Philip Massinger\u2019s early 17th century tragicomedy The Renegado is a swashbuckling tale of kidnapping, piracy, and forbidden romance. Asambeg, the cruel viceroy of Tunis, has abducted Paulina, a virtuous Venetian maiden, and keeps her in his seraglio. Her brother Vitelli follows them to Tunis, disguised as a merchant and accompanied by his comic servant Gazet and Jesuit priest Francisco, to try and rescue her. In the market, he is spellbound by the beautiful Turkish princess Donusa, who instantly falls in love with him, despite the jealousy of her powerful suitor, Mustapha, basha of Aleppo. Meanwhile, Antonio Grimaldi, a notorious pirate who has converted to Islam, comes to Tunis to stir up trouble. Massinger\u2019s play deals with the often volatile encounters between Christians and Muslims in an age of imperial expansion, and, while it presents some Islamic stereotypes, is a fascinating and exciting drama of romantic and religious conversion.
