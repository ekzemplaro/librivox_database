{"books":{"16":{"id":"4855","title":"Where the Path Breaks","description":"The soldier awakened from the brink of death eight months after his injury on the battlefield. As he slowly regained his senses and his memory, the face of a girl creeps into his mind, and he soon recalls that this girl had married him out of pity on the day he went into battle. The wedding had been a true \"war wedding\".<br \/>Inspired by the face and the vague recollections which were taking shape, and after learning that his day-bride had since remarried (believing her day-husband killed in action), the battle-scarred soldier decides to re-invent himself, take on a new name, and seek a new life. To what extent his former life would have upon his adopted life unfolds in unforgettable detail with each chapter of Where the Path Breaks.<br \/>Captain Charles de Cr\u00e9spigny was a pseudonym used by Charles Norris (C.N.) Williamson.
