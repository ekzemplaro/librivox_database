{"books":{"3":{"id":"3285","title":"America, Europe, and the Song of Los","description":"<p>The English poet, painter, and engraver William Blake (1757-1827) created and self-published a unique series of books that combine poetry with visual art. Few copies of these books were sold in Blake\u2019s lifetime, but they have greatly influenced subsequent writers and artists.<br \/>Blake\u2019s illustrated poems America (1793), Europe (1794), and The Song of Los (consisting of Africa and Asia; 1795) use symbolic characters of his own invention to retell the history of the human race from its origin in the garden of Eden to the eventual resurrection of the dead. In these poems, the spirit Urizen oppresses the human race with laws and religions that pervert the truths of the everlasting gospel. During the eighteenth century, however, the demon Orc (firstborn son of the eternal prophet Los and his wife, the nocturnal dreamer Enitharmon) breaks his chains, arousing rebellion in America and later in France, with terrible though liberating consequences.<br \/>In this recording, the poems are presented in the sequence indicated by the narrative: first Africa (The Song of Los, plates 3-4), then America and Europe, and finally Asia (The Song of Los, plates 6-7). (Plates 1, 5, and 8 of The Song of Los are full-page illustrations, with no text; plate 2 is the book's overall title page.) (Summary by E. H. Blackmore.)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/poeticalworksofw01blakuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"4","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3285","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Continental_prophesies","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"590","first_name":"William","last_name":"Blake","dob":"1757","dod":"1827"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"183219","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Africa (The Song of Los, plates 3-4)","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3929","display_name":"E.
