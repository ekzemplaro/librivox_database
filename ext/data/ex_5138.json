{"books":{"17":{"id":"5138","title":"Ten Days in the Light of Acca","description":"This work is the story of a pilgrimage made over a hundred years ago by a group of American pilgrims. They were not headed for Canterbury, Rome or Jerusalem. Rather, they were headed for an historical but remote prison-city in a far corner of the Ottoman Empire. \u2018Akk\u00e1 (Akko), now a city in Israel which attracts thousands of Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed pilgrims each year, was but little thought of in that early period. It was originally the final place of exile and imprisonment for Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, a Persian nobleman who proclaimed that He was the Promised One of all religions and Messenger of God for this day and age. It was also the home of His eldest son, \u2018Abb\u00e1s Effend\u00ed, known as \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 (Servant of Bah\u00e1), or \u00c1q\u00e1 (the Master), who was the leader of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith after Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s passing in 1892. The first Western Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed pilgrims arrived in 1898, which was then followed by a nearly continuous stream of pilgrims that has now grown into a river of devoted followers from all parts of the globe. The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith was a little known religion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but has now become widely recognised as the newest of the great world religions and the second-most widespread religion on the planet. The author, Julia M. Grundy, is a bit of a mystery. She was in the pilgrimage party of Mr. and Mrs. Howard MacNutt in 1905. This book, published in 1907, is the result of that journey. It contains the teachings and wisdom which Grundy recorded during her brief stay in the Holy Land. While these insights may be valuable, one must remember that Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds do not consider \u2018pilgrim\u2019s notes\u2019 as authoritative. They may not represent the actual words spoken by \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1. For information on authoritative Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed teachings, please consult the writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi.
