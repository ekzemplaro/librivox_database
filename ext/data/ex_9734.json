{"books":{"17":{"id":"9734","title":"Triumph of the Egg: A Book of Impressions from American Life In Tales and Poems","description":"<p>\u201cThe Triumph of the Egg\u201d is a collection of stories and poems by Sherwood Anderson. Abandoning the interconnected quality of his more famous \u201cWinesburg, Ohio,\u201d the author adopts a variety of perspectives and settings while exploring similar themes: personal growth, disillusionment, loneliness, and urban-rural contrast. In the North American Review, critic Lawrence Gilman wrote, \u201cMr. Anderson has achieved a beauty that irradiates his page.\u201d Though largely overshadowed by that celebrated, earlier book, \u201cThe Triumph of the Egg\u201d remains a foundational work for Modernist literature, proven by its winning the first annual Dial Award from the influential journal The Dial.<p>\n<p>\nNOTE TO LISTENERS: The second story in this collection, \u201cI Want to Know Why,\u201d contains language that may be offensive.<p>\n(summary by Ben Adams)<p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/triumpheggabook01andegoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1921","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9734","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Triumph_of_the_Egg","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10","first_name":"Sherwood","last_name":"Anderson","dob":"1876","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"335357","section_number":"0","title":"Prologue","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/triumphoftheegg_00_anderson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9372","display_name":"Ben
