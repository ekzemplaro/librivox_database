{"books":{"5":{"id":"6764","title":"Divine Companion","description":"James Allen was a British philosophical writer known for his inspirational books and poetry and as a pioneer of the self-help movement. \n\nIn the introduction Lily Allen writes: \"It cannot be said of this book that James Allen wrote it at any particular time or in any one year, for he was engaged in it over many years and those who have eyes to see and hearts to understand will find in its pages the spiritual history of his life. It was his own wish that The Divine Companion should be the last manuscript of his to be published. 'It is the story of my soul,' he said, 'and should be read last of all my books, so that the student may understand and find my message in its pages.'\" (Summary by Wikipedia and Lily Allen)<p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/james-allen.in1woord.nl\/?text=the-divine-companion#p0","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6764","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/divine_companion_0705_librivox\/divine_companion_0705_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-divine-companion-by-james-allen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:29:11","totaltimesecs":8951,"authors":[{"id":"1323","first_name":"James","last_name":"Allen","dob":"1864","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/divine_companion_0705_librivox","sections":[{"id":"99427","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1: The Divine Companion","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2647","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"99428","section_number":"2","title":"Part 2: The Divine Dialogue","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2392","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"},{"reader_id":"6446","display_name":"Bob Gonzalez"}]},{"id":"99429","section_number":"3","title":"Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 1 - Prophecies","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1495","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"99430","section_number":"4","title":"Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 2 - Exhortations","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"771","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"99431","section_number":"5","title":"Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 3 - Instructions","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"903","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"99432","section_number":"6","title":"Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 4 - Discourse","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"743","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"27","name":"Romance"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"},{"id":"100","name":"Psychology"}],"translators":[]}}}
