{"books":{"5":{"id":"10264","title":"Cuisine","description":"Ella Wheeler Wilcox was an American author and poet, who was considered a popular poet rather than a literary poet, in her poems she expresses sentiments of cheer and optimism in plainly written, rhyming verse. Her world view is expressed in the title of her poem \"Whatever Is\u2014Is Best\", suggesting an echo of Alexander Pope's \"Whatever is, is right.\"\n\nNone of Wilcox's works were included by F. O. Matthiessen in The Oxford Book of American Verse, but Hazel Felleman chose no fewer than fourteen of her poems for Best Loved Poems of the American People, while Martin Gardner selected \"The Way Of The World\" and \"The Winds of Fate\" for Best Remembered Poems.\n\nShe is frequently cited in anthologies of bad poetry, such as The Stuffed Owl: An Anthology of Bad Verse and Very Bad Poetry.  - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4006","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10264","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/the_cuisine_1510.poem_librivox\/the_cuisine_1510.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-cuisine-by-ella-wheeler-wilcox\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:14:16","totaltimesecs":856,"authors":[{"id":"340","first_name":"Ella Wheeler","last_name":"Wilcox","dob":"1850","dod":"1919"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/the_cuisine_1510.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"351658","section_number":"1","title":"The Cuisine - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/cuisine_wilcox_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"131","file_name":"cuisine_wilcox_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"351655","section_number":"2","title":"The Cuisine - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/cuisine_wilcox_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"145","file_name":"cuisine_wilcox_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"351656","section_number":"3","title":"The Cuisine - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/cuisine_wilcox_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"150","file_name":"cuisine_wilcox_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"351659","section_number":"4","title":"The Cuisine - Read by JMC","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/cuisine_wilcox_jmc_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"114","file_name":"cuisine_wilcox_jmc_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10342","display_name":"Jim McNamara"}]},{"id":"351657","section_number":"5","title":"The Cuisine - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/cuisine_wilcox_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"170","file_name":"cuisine_wilcox_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"351660","section_number":"6","title":"The Cuisine - Read by RG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/cuisine_wilcox_rg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"146","file_name":"cuisine_wilcox_rg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
