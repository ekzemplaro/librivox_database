{"books":{"2":{"id":"8991","title":"Life's Enthusiasms","description":"The words in this essay on positive thought sing like those in Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass.\" The author praises joyous living and recommends certain routes to its attainment. He explores schooling (public secondary and the university), travel, and the study of nature as ways to stay buoyant during life's trials. He also praises the power of the arts (literature, music, painting, sculpture) to keep spirits soaring.
