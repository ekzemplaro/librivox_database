{"books":{"93":{"id":"1621","title":"Collected Poems of Rupert Brooke","description":"<p>Rupert Chawner Brooke was an English poet known for his idealistic War Sonnets written during the First World War (especially The Soldier), as well as for his poetry written outside of war, especially The Old Vicarage, Grantchester and The Great Lover. He was also known for his boyish good looks, which prompted the Irish poet William Butler Yeats to describe him as \"the handsomest young man in England\".
