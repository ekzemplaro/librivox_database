{"books":{"56":{"id":"2272","title":"Scalp Hunters","description":"\"Unroll the world\u2019s map, and look upon the great northern continent of America. Away to the wild west, away toward the setting sun, away beyond many a far meridian, let your eyes wander. Rest them where golden rivers rise among peaks that carry the eternal snow. Rest them there.\n\nYou are looking upon a land whose features are un-furrowed by human hands, still bearing the marks of the Almighty mould, as upon the morning of creation; a region whose every object wears the impress of God\u2019s image. His ambient spirit lives in the silent grandeur of its mountains, and speaks in the roar of its mighty rivers: a region redolent of romance, rich in the reality of adventure.\n\nFollow me, with the eye of your mind, through scenes of wild beauty, of savage sublimity.\"\n\nSo begins this early book by Mayne Reid, a book of romance, of adventure, and of the wide open spaces of the Wild West.
