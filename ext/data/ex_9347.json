{"books":{"10":{"id":"9347","title":"Shining Gateway","description":"Students of the works of James Allen all over the world will welcome with joy another book from his able pen. In this work we find the Prophet of Meditation in one of his deepest and yet most lucid expositions. How wonderfully he deals with fundamental principles! Here the reader will find no vague statement of generalities, for the writer enters with tender reverence into every detail of human experience. It is as though he came back to The Shining Gateway, and, standing there, he reviewed all the way up which his own feet have traveled, passing over no temptation that is common to man; knowing that the obstacles that barred his ascending pathway, or the clouds that at times obscured his vision, are the common experiences of all those who have set their faces towards the heights of Blessed Vision. As we read his words now, he seems to stand and beckon to us, saying, \"Come on, my fellow Pilgrims; it is straight ahead to the Shining Gateway; I have blazed the track for you.\" In sending forth this, another posthumous volume from his pen, we have no doubt but that it will help many and many an aspiring soul up to the heights, until at last they too stand within The Shining Gateway. - Summary by Editor, The Shining Gateway<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/james-allen.in1woord.nl\/?text=the-shining-gateway","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9347","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/shininggateway_1501_librivox\/shininggateway_1501_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-shining-gateway-by-james-allen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:26:40","totaltimesecs":5200,"authors":[{"id":"1323","first_name":"James","last_name":"Allen","dob":"1864","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/shininggateway_1501_librivox","sections":[{"id":"324173","section_number":"0","title":"Forward","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_00_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"143","file_name":"shininggateway_00_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324174","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1: The Shining Gateway of Meditation","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_01_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"761","file_name":"shininggateway_01_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324175","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2: Temptation","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_02_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"756","file_name":"shininggateway_02_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324176","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3: Regeneration","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_03_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"569","file_name":"shininggateway_03_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324177","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4: Actions and Motives","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_04_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"565","file_name":"shininggateway_04_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324178","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5: Morality and Religion","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_05_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"296","file_name":"shininggateway_05_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324179","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6: Memory, Repetition, and Habit","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_06_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"570","file_name":"shininggateway_06_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324180","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7: Words and Wisdom","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_07_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"431","file_name":"shininggateway_07_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324181","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8: Truth Made Manifest","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_08_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"172","file_name":"shininggateway_08_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324182","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9: Spiritual Humility","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_09_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"514","file_name":"shininggateway_09_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]},{"id":"324183","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10: Spiritual Strength","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/shininggateway_10_allen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"423","file_name":"shininggateway_10_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2196","display_name":"Andrea Fiore"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
