{"books":{"35":{"id":"9022","title":"Flight of the Shadow","description":"A fantastical story of personal growth and a warning against the dangers of keeping secrets. This novel by George MacDonald is a deceptively easy read aimed to be accessible to teens, but the ideas will remain in your mind long afterwards. Beautifully written in the style of Gothic Novels of the nineteenth century, a story about relationships and redemption, secrets and confessions and an inspiring example of how to live in the light. - Summary by Beth Thomas","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8902","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"36","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9022","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"631","first_name":"George","last_name":"MacDonald","dob":"1824","dod":"1905"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"315970","section_number":"1","title":"MRS.
