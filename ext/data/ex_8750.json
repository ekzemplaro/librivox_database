{"books":{"24":{"id":"8750","title":"Heroes Every Child Should Know","description":"The endeavour has been made in this volume to bring together the heroic men of different races, periods and types; and in the selection of material the most attractive, intelligent and authoritative literature has been drawn upon. In cases in which the material selected belongs distinctively to the best literature, no changes have been made, although narratives have been abbreviated; in cases in which the material has a historical rather than a distinctively literary quality, the text has been treated for \"substance of doctrine,\" and omissions have been freely made, and connecting words, phrases and even sentences have been introduced to give the narrative clear connection and completeness. In the preparation of the material for the volume the intelligence and skill of Miss Kate Stephens have been so freely used that she is entitled to the fullest recognition as associate editor. - Summary by Hamilton Wright Mabie","url_text_source":"http:\/\/gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4265","language":"English","copyright_year":"1908","num_sections":"25","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8750","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1109","first_name":"Hamilton Wright","last_name":"Mabie","dob":"1846","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"307730","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/heroeseverychildshouldknow_00_mabie_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8337","display_name":"Claudia Salto"}]},{"id":"307731","section_number":"1","title":"Perseus part 1 by Charles Kingsley","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/heroeseverychildshouldknow_01_mabie_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9000","display_name":"Ramon Escamilla"}]},{"id":"307732","section_number":"2","title":"Perseus part 2 by Charles Kingsley","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/heroeseverychildshouldknow_02_mabie_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9000","display_name":"Ramon Escamilla"}]},{"id":"307734","section_number":"3","title":"Hercules by Kate Stephens","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/smijen\/heroeseverychildshouldknow_03_mabie_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9256","display_name":"Daniel J.
