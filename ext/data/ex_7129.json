{"books":{"34":{"id":"7129","title":"Essays book 3","description":"Michel Eyquem de Montaigne is one of the most influential writers of the French Renaissance, known for popularising the essay as a literary genre. He is also known as the father of Modern Skepticism. His pieces became famous for his apparent effortless ability to merge serious intellectual speculation with casual anecdotes and autobiography. His main work, Essais (translated literally as \"Attempts\" but traditionally as \"Essays\"), contains some of the still most widely influential essays ever written. This is the third volume of that important work.
