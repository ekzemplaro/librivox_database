Pauline Johnson or just Pauline Johnson, was a Canadian writer and performer popular in the late 19th century. Johnson was notable for her poems and performances that celebrated her First Nations heritage; she also had half English ancestry. One such poem is the frequently anthologized \"The Song My Paddle Sings\". Her poetry was published in Canada, the United States and Great Britain. Johnson was one of a generation of widely read writers who began to define a Canadian literature.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5625","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5200","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/train_dogs_1102_librivox\/train_dogs_1102_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-train-dogs-by-e-pauline-johnson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:22:30","totaltimesecs":1350,"authors":[{"id":"1763","first_name":"E.
