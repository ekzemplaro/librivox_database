{"books":{"99":{"id":"9994","title":"Curiosities of Street Literature","description":"This is a collection of broadsides from London. Broadsides are short, popular publications, a precurson to today's tabloid journalism. The collection contains sensationalist and sometimes comical stories about criminal conduct, love, the Royal Family, politics, as well as gallows' literature.Gallow's literature (confessions, verses etc. relating to individuals condemned to public execution) were often sold at the execution. As a collection these broadsides are a reminder of how important the printer was at this time -- it is surely no coincidence that the printers are printed at the end of every broadside, while the authors remain anonymous.  - Summary by
