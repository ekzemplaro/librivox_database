Legge, editor<br><br>\u201cThis book is a prolonged effort to establish a distinction between what is called mind and what is called matter. Nothing is more simple than to realise this distinction when you do not go deeply into it; nothing is more difficult when you analyse it a little. At first sight, it seems impossible to confuse things so far apart as a thought and a block of stone; but on reflection this great contrast vanishes,  and other differences have to be sought which are less apparent and of which one has not hitherto dreamed.\u201d (from The Mind and the Brain)<\/p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/21077","language":"English","copyright_year":"1907","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1316","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/mindandbrain_0801\/mindandbrain_0801_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-mind-and-the-brain-by-alfred-binet\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:49:51","totaltimesecs":24591,"authors":[{"id":"4482","first_name":" Alfred","last_name":"Binet","dob":"1857","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/mindandbrain_0801","sections":[{"id":"142720","section_number":"1","title":"Book 1 The Definition of Matter -  Chapter 1 - Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"499","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"688","display_name":"J.
