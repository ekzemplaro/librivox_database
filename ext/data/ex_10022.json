{"books":{"69":{"id":"10022","title":"Blind Love","description":"Collins had started writing the novel in 1887, when newspapers were full of stories about Fenian violence in the wake of the previous year's defeat of the First Irish Home Rule Bill. Collins frequented Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese off London's Fleet Street and borrowed some traits for his male protagonist from John O'Connor Power who was also well known in the convivial tavern. 'Strangers wondered whether Lord Harry was an actor or a Roman Catholic priest'[1] Collins links the Irish Question to the Woman Question. The novel recounts the story of Lord Harry Norland, a member of a squad of political assassins; the book's heroine is Iris Henley, a bold and nonconformist Englishwoman who falls in love with the Irish Norland despite his criminal activities (the \"blind love\" of the title).[2] The title was originally to have been Lord Harry, the colloquial name for the devil.
