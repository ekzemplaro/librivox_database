Also included are\nthe basics of the (then) fairly new concept of relativity and its impact\non emerging scientific theories.<br><br>\n\nSince first posted at Project Gutenberg in 2006, the text of\nThe Outline of Science, Volume 1 has consistently ranked in the\n\"Top 100 EBooks\" category.<br><br>\n\n(Summary by James Christopher) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/20417","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2227","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/outline_of_science_2_0810_librivox\/outline_of_science_2_0810_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/outline-of-science-volume-1-by-j-arthur-thomson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"9:59:33","totaltimesecs":35973,"authors":[{"id":"1767","first_name":"J.
