{"books":{"18":{"id":"10131","title":"Land of the Broads","description":"The Broads area of Norfolk and Suffolk is in the East Anglian region of England. It is the location of Britain's third largest inland waterway system and largest protected wetland area. Many examples of rare flora and fauna are found only in this unique location which has also been designated as a national park.\n\nThis book: The Land of the Broads, is a practical guide to the extensive but (at one time), little-known district of the Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk.\n\nWritten (and now narrated) for the use of all who take an interest in one of the Quaintest and most Old-World parts of England, either from an Archaeological, Historical, Picturesque, or Sporting point of view.\n\nSo, join me if you will, on another auditory cruise around these unique waterways through expansive  landscapes under wide open skies. - Summary by The Land of the Broads \/
