{"books":{"7":{"id":"3795","title":"1 Chronicles","description":"<p>The Books of Chronicles (Hebrew Divrei Hayyamim, \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, Greek Paralipomenon, \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd) are part of the Hebrew Bible (Jewish Tanakh and Christian Old Testament). In the Masoretic Text, it appears as the first or last book of the Ketuvim (the latter arrangement also making it the final book of the Jewish bible). Chronicles largely parallels the Davidic narratives in the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings. It appears in two parts (I & II Chronicles), immediately following 1 & 2 Samuel and 1 & 2 Kings as a summary of them with minor details sometimes added. The division of Chronicles and its place in the Christian canon of the Old Testament are based upon the Septuagint. The author of Chronicles, termed \"the Chronicler,\" may also have written Ezra and Nehemiah. His work is an important source of information about Israel after the Babylonian exile.
