{"books":{"12":{"id":"268","title":"Love Conquers All","description":"<p>Robert Benchley, 1889-1945, was a writer, humorist and actor of note during the 1920s through the early 1940s. Born in Massachusetts, he spent his early literary career in New York City as an editor, critic and columnist for many of the major magazines of the day.<\/p>\n<p>Along with George Kaufman, Dorothy Parker and Harpo Marx, he was an original \"member\" of the Algonquin Round Table. His popularity led him to a side career in radio and film, which took him to California in his later years. Writers as diverse as James Thurber, Woody Allen and Dave Barry have credited Benchley as an influence.<\/p>\n<p><i>Love Conquers All<\/i>, originally published in 1922 is the second collection (of fifteen) gathering together Benchley's humorous essays and reviews. Some references are dated, of course, but the surreal and mundane targets of Benchley's wit will be familiar to everyone. This volume collects 63 excellent gems from his early professional work, when Benchley's enthusiasm and style were approaching their peak.<br \/>\n(Summary by Ted Delorme)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/15851","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/268","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/love_conquers_all_librivox\/love_conquers_all_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/love-conquers-all-by-robert-benchley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:53.02","totaltimesecs":413.02,"authors":[{"id":"3557","first_name":"Robert C.","last_name":"Benchley","dob":"1889","dod":"1945"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/love_conquers_all_librivox","sections":[{"id":"124387","section_number":"1","title":"Chapters 01-05","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2112","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124388","section_number":"2","title":"Chapters 06-10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2245","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124389","section_number":"3","title":"Chapters 11-15","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1797","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124390","section_number":"4","title":"Chapters 16-20","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2043","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124391","section_number":"5","title":"Chapters 21-25","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1515","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124392","section_number":"6","title":"Chapters 26-30","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2689","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124393","section_number":"7","title":"Chapters 31-35","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2254","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124394","section_number":"8","title":"Chapters 36-40","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1821","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124395","section_number":"9","title":"Chapters 41-45","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2099","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124396","section_number":"10","title":"Chapters 46-50","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1694","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124397","section_number":"11","title":"Chapters 51-55","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1687","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124398","section_number":"12","title":"Chapters 56-59","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1488","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"124399","section_number":"13","title":"Chapters 60-63","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1338","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
