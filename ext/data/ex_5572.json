{"books":{"20":{"id":"5572","title":"Secret of Lonesome Cove","description":"A body is found on the beach not far from a New England town one morning. Curiously, nobody recognizes the dead woman, and nobody in or near the town seems to be a suspect in a possible murder, therefore most of them assume that she simply washed ashore from a passing vessel. Only problem is vessels didn't pass that stretch of the coast because of it's peculiar tides and eddies; hence its name, Lonesome Cove. Following the finding of the body, the officials of the town start acting a bit peculiar towards how to handle the dead body. The sheriff, the attorney in the town, the village gossip, and even the town doctor all seem to want the identification of the body hushed up. And therefore the body is immediately buried, and the officials hope all will be forgotten and done with. Cause of death: drowning. Enter Chester Kent, who isn't convinced in the same way that the townspeople are, and is willing to pull at his ear lobe in an effort to determine the identity of the body, and how it came to it's demise.
