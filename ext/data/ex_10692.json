{"books":{"26":{"id":"10692","title":"Children's Tabernacle; Or, Hand Work and Heart Work","description":"Bored with whittling, embroidery and other amusements, five children and their mother set out to build a model of the tabernacle. As the pillars are fashioned and the curtains sewn, the children learn the importance of types in the Old Testament. The showbread on the table in the Holy Place is a type of Christ being the bread of life; the offerings for leprosy were a type of cleansing from sin; the Holy of Holies was a type of God's presence, etc. One day, though, twelve-year-old Dora finds herself in trouble. Will the way be opened for her--from a mere tabernacle model to a new knowledge of forgiveness? - Summary by Bethesda Lily","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/49643","language":"English","copyright_year":"1875","num_sections":"27","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10692","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10553","first_name":"Charlotte Maria","last_name":"Tucker","dob":"1821","dod":"1893"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"364069","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/childrenstabernacle_00_tucker_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10662","display_name":"Bethesda Lily"}]},{"id":"364070","section_number":"1","title":"I.
