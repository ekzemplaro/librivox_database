The original edition was published in 1916; this edition, published in 1921, contains 11 more poems. Mew's poetry is varied in style and content, but manifests a concern with gender issues throughout. Mew's life was marked by loneliness and depression, and she eventually committed suicide. Her work earned her the admiration of her peers, including Virginia Woolf, who characterized her as \"very good and quite unlike anyone else.\" (Summary by Elizabeth Klett)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/stream\/farmersbride00mewcuoft#page\/n3\/mode\/2up","language":"English","copyright_year":"1921","num_sections":"2","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3953","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/farmers_bride_1001_librivox\/farmers_bride_1001_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-farmers-bride-by-charlotte-mew\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:06:47","totaltimesecs":4007,"authors":[{"id":"403","first_name":"Charlotte","last_name":"Mew","dob":"1869","dod":"1928"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/farmers_bride_1001_librivox","sections":[{"id":"25074","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2071","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"25075","section_number":"2","title":"2 - Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1936","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"63","name":"Single author"}],"translators":[]}}}
