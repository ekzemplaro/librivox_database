{"books":{"10":{"id":"9030","title":"Love & Freindship, and Other Early Works","description":"This book draws together some of Jane Austen's earliest literary efforts.  It includes \"Love & Freindship\" and \"Lesley Castle\" both told through the medium of letters written by the characters.  It also contains her wonderful \"History of England\" and a \"Collection of Letters\" and lastly a chapter containing \"Scraps\".\nIn these offerings, we may see the beginnings of Miss Austen's literary style.  We may also discern traces of characters that we encounter in her later works.  G. K. Chesterton in his preface, for example, says of a passage in Love and Freindship; \"... is there not the foreshadowing of another and more famous father; and do we not hear for a moment, in the rustic cottage by the Uske, the unmistakable voice of Mr. Bennet?\"  These works are certainly worth exploring for their own sakes and not simply as historical relics.\n - Summary by Noel Badrian","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lovefriendshipot00austuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9030","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"155","first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Austen","dob":"1775","dod":"1817"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"316162","section_number":"0","title":"Preface by G.
