{"books":{"6":{"id":"10704","title":"Poetry Everywhere","description":"Sir William Schwenck Gilbert was an English dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator best known for the fourteen comic operas (known as the Savoy operas) produced in collaboration with the composer Sir Arthur Sullivan. The most famous of these include H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, The Mikado.\n\nGilbert also wrote the Bab Ballads, an extensive collection of light verse accompanied by his own comical drawings. His creative output included over 75 plays and libretti, numerous stories, poems, lyrics and various other comic and serious pieces. His plays and realistic style of stage direction inspired other dramatists, including Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. According to The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, Gilbert's \"lyrical facility and his mastery of metre raised the poetical quality of comic opera to a position that it had never reached before and has not reached since\" - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/934","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"7","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10704","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/poetry_everywhere_1603.poem_librivox\/poetry_everywhere_1603.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/poetry-everywhere-by-w-s-gilbert\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:08:42","totaltimesecs":522,"authors":[{"id":"334","first_name":"W.
