We decided to have a collection of short works with a difference. We challenged our readers to find any short works which had 'five' in the title - in any language. They have done us proud, and the collection extends to three volumes of short stories, poems, fairy tales, memoirs, non-fiction and bible readings, in six languages.  This is the third volume.
