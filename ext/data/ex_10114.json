{"books":{"13":{"id":"10114","title":"Reminiscences Among the Rocks: In Connection with the Geological Survey of Canada","description":"An autobiography of the life of T C Weston as he worked for the Geological Survey of Canada from 1859-1894. The book follows his career as a lapidary for the GSC from his first arrival in Canada, through his many years of field work and study, until his final year under the service of the GSC. The accounts include many first-hand experiences in the western territories, which had been barely unexplored by western settlers to date. Weston's humorous anecdotes and boundless respect and awe for the natural world make this book extremely entertaining and interesting. - Summary by Brigid Christison","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/reminiscencesam00westgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1899","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10114","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11524","first_name":"Thomas Chesmer","last_name":"Weston","dob":"1832","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"346960","section_number":"1","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346961","section_number":"2","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346962","section_number":"3","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346963","section_number":"4","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346964","section_number":"5","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346965","section_number":"6","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346966","section_number":"7","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346967","section_number":"8","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346968","section_number":"9","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346969","section_number":"10","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346970","section_number":"11","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346971","section_number":"12","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346972","section_number":"13","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]},{"id":"346973","section_number":"14","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10207","display_name":"Brigid Christison"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
