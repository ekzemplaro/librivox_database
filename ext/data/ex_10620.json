{"books":{"6":{"id":"10620","title":"Republic of the Future","description":"<b> or Socialism a Reality <\/b><\/br>\nIn the year 2050, Wolfgang travels to the socialist city of New York. He writes enthusiastically to his friend Hannevig describing the wonders of the journey (via pneumatic tube under the ocean) and vastness of the city. He then turns his eye and pen to the effects of true equality of the sexes and freedom from work. Unfortunately for the New Yorkers, they do not create the desired utopia but just the opposite.
