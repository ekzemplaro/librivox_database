{"books":{"25":{"id":"1430","title":"First Men in the Moon","description":"<p>Britain won the Moon Race! Decades before Neal Armstrong took his \"giant leap for mankind\" two intrepid adventurers from Lympne, England, journeyed there using not a rocket, but an antigravity coating.<\/p><p>Mr. Bedford, who narrates the tale, tells of how he fell in with eccentric inventor Mr. Cavor, grew to believe in his researches, helped him build a sphere for traveling in space, and then partnered with him in an expedition to the Moon.<\/p><p>What they found was fantastic! There was not only air and water, but the Moon was honeycombed with caverns and tunnels in which lived an advanced civilization of insect-like beings. While Bedford is frightened by them and bolts home, Cavor stays and is treated with great respect.<\/p><p>So why didn't Armstrong and later astronauts find the evidence of all this? Well, according to broadcasts by Cavor over the newly-discovered radio technology, he told the Selenites too much about mankind, and apparently, they removed the welcome mat!
