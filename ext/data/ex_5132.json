{"books":{"10":{"id":"5132","title":"Masquerader","description":"The Masquerader is one of two Katherine Cecil Thurston\u2019s books that appeared on the Publisher\u2019s Weekly best-seekers list in 1905 (The other, The Gambler, is also in the Librivox collection). The Masquerader is part mystery, part romance and part political thriller \u2013 all tied up in one neat package. Nature has a way of sometimes making two people nearly indistinguishable in appearance. Such is the premise for this book. John Chilcote, a British politician, and John Loder, a man down on his luck meet by accident one night during one of London\u2019s worst fogs. Chilcote, addicted to morphine, needs to escape his political responsibilities and presents an offer to Loder to exchange places occasionally. Loder, reluctant at first, finally accepts the proposal and finds he fits into Chilcote\u2019s role \u2013 perhaps better than Chilcote himself. The exchanges become more frequent and lengthy. Loder, finding his way, discovers he is worthy of Chilcote\u2019s position, especially during an international crisis, but when Chilcote reclaims his life, Loder\u2019s accomplishments try to unravel. Two women are intimately involved in this story \u2013 one is Chilcote\u2019s wife, Eve, who is a wife of convenience rather than love. The second is Lady Astrupp. We will say little about Lady Astrupp except that she adds a great deal of suspense to the story. In such a charade, things do not always go as expected. Does Chilcote break his drug habit? What becomes of Loder? Does Eve become suspicious as a wife might? Is the masquerade exposed by\u2026\u2026but then I would be telling you more than you should know beforehand.(Summary by Tom Weiss)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5422","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5132","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/masquerader_tw_librivox\/masquerader_tw_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Chilcote_M.P.","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-masquerader-by-katherine-thurston\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"9:16:16","totaltimesecs":33376,"authors":[{"id":"1654","first_name":"Katherine Cecil","last_name":"Thurston","dob":"1875","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/masquerader_tw_librivox","sections":[{"id":"56351","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapters 1 through 3 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3243","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56352","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Chapters 4 through 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2932","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56353","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Chapters 7 through 9 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3000","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56354","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Chapters 10 through 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2911","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56355","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Chapters 13 through 15","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2715","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56356","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Chapters 16 through 18","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2778","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56357","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Chapters 19 through 21","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2798","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56358","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Chapters 22 through 24","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3933","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56359","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Chapters 25 through 27","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2998","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56360","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Chapters 28 through 30","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2160","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]},{"id":"56361","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Chapters 21 through 34","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3908","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3488","display_name":"Tom Weiss"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"22","name":"Detective Fiction"},{"id":"27","name":"Romance"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"99","name":"Political Science"}],"translators":[]}}}
