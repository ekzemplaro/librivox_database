The Persian text was first lithographed in Bombay in 1882 and printed in Cairo in 1911. \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 was the eldest son and appointed successor of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, the Founder of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith. The original text of this work was written and published anonymously, and the first English translation (by Johanna Dawud) was published in London in 1910 and Chicago in 1918, under the title \u2018Mysterious Forces of Civilization\u2019 written by \"an Eminent Bahai Philosopher.\" This audiobook is based on the 1918 edition. Another translation was completed by Marzieh Gail and published in 1957, with an introduction by Horace Holley. The title was re-translated as \u201cThe Secret of Divine Civilization\u201d. The book was widely known in its time as an attempt to improve the degraded condition of Persia (Iran). The author frequently references current issues that were being debated, such as whether to modernize and accept Western technology, or to reject Western culture and rely on technology developed in Persia and the Islamic world.
