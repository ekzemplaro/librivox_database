{"books":{"13":{"id":"10906","title":"Pretty Sister Of Jos\u00e9","description":"Pepita would rather become a witch than a wife. She's seen too many women, including her mother, wither away at their husband's hands. Popular and respected, our gentle, but fiercely independent heroine immediately grows cruel and cold to any suitor drawn in by her allure. When a famous bullfighting lady killer from Madrid takes interest in her, will Pepita's resolve crumble with disastrous consequences?   \n\nA hit upon its 1899 release, this novella later spawned both a play and silent film adaptation. Despite its public popularity, its (now rather tame) intense love story and positive portrayal of Spaniards drew some controversy from English critics. \n - Summary by Mary Kay","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/25726","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10906","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"150","first_name":"Frances Hodgson","last_name":"Burnett","dob":"1849","dod":"1924"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"371308","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371309","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter I, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371310","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter I, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371311","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter I, Part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371318","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter II, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371319","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter II, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371320","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter II, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371321","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter II, Part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371322","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter III, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371323","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter III, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371324","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter III, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371325","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter IV, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371326","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter IV, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"371327","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter IV, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"27","name":"Romance"},{"id":"53","name":"Published 1800 -1900"}],"translators":[]}}}
