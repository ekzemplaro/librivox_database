{"books":{"19":{"id":"3843","title":"Czar's Spy","description":"<p>William Le Queux was a British novelist and prolific writer of mysteries. Indeed, mystery surrounds the author himself as to whether he was a spy or rather just a self-promoter. Regardless of which is true, Le Queux brings us a story of intrigue and espionage that travels across Europe in the true spirit of a good mystery. There are shootings, burglaries, romances, escapes from prisons, and intricate conspiracies that may surprise and leave you scratching your head as you try to solve this \u201cwhodunit\u201d. In the best tradition of a good mystery however, you may need to wait for the final chapters to discover the truth.
