She now loves a Greek sculptor, who only wanted her for a model, but even that will not happen. She has been replaced by another woman for the statue of Arachne. Who do the gods see her with? Is it the Greek, or someone else?\n<br><br>\nThis work is the last written and published in German by Georg Ebers before he died in 1898.
