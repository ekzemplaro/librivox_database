{"books":{"4":{"id":"4065","title":"Song of Hugh Glass","description":"This poem tells a story that begins in 1823 - just after the Leavenworth campaign against the Arikara Indians - and follows an expedition of Major Andrew Henry during a series of arduous journeys over the Trans-Missouri region. \r\n\r\nThe poem focuses upon the relationship between two trappers - Hugh Glass and Jamie - who, after fighting and hunting together, consequently develop a close friendship. The poem revolves around the betrayal of Hugh by Jamie: who leaves Hugh alone \"as good as dead\" to die by the Missouri. But Hugh lives - and recovers against all odds, pushing on with murderous intent to track down the ex-friend who left him helpless and expiring. \r\n\r\nThe final canto describes the moving denouement: Hugh and Jamie both are forced to recognize their own weaknesses, and then come to terms with the implications of their individual realizations. \r\n\r\n(Introduction by Godsend)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/hughglasssong00neihrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4065","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox\/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cycle_of_the_West#The_Song_of_Hugh_Glass","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-song-of-hugh-glass-by-neihardt-john\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:21:25","totaltimesecs":8485,"authors":[{"id":"517","first_name":"","last_name":"Neihardt","dob":"1881","dod":"1973"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox","sections":[{"id":"28419","section_number":"1","title":"01 Graybeard and Goldhair","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1777","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"28420","section_number":"2","title":"02 The Awakening","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"715","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"28421","section_number":"3","title":"03 The Crawl","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3836","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"28422","section_number":"4","title":"04 The Return of the Ghost","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"982","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"28423","section_number":"5","title":"05 Jamie","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1175","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
