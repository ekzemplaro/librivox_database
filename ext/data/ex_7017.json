{"books":{"60":{"id":"7017","title":"Mince Pie","description":"Mince Pie is a compilation of humorous sketches, poetry, and essays written by Christopher Morley. Morley sets the tone in the preface: \"If one asks what excuse there can be for prolonging the existence of these trifles, my answer is that there is no excuse. But a copy on the bedside shelf may possibly pave the way to easy slumber. Only a mind \"debauched by learning\" (in Doctor Johnson's phrase) will scrutinize them too anxiously.\" (Summary from preface and by lubee930)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/13694","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"61","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7017","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/mince_pie_1211_librivox\/mince_pie_1211_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/mince-pie-by-christopher-morley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:00:21","totaltimesecs":21621,"authors":[{"id":"2327","first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Morley","dob":"1890","dod":"1957"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/mince_pie_1211_librivox","sections":[{"id":"106093","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
