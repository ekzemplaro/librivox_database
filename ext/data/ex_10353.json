{"books":{"58":{"id":"10353","title":"California Sketches New And Old","description":"Here we meet all sorts of characters and situations in California\u2019s early history: gunmen, outlaws, lynch mobs, raging storms, mining camps, lost clergymen, and more, penned by one who lived among and carefully observed his subjects. Oscar Penn Fitzgerald was a Methodist clergyman, journalist and educator. He served as California Superintendent of Public Instruction (1867\u20131871). His California Sketches were published in two series (1879 and 1881) and a consolidated volume (1895). This reading is based on the consolidated volume with the addition of the sketches from the first books that were omitted in the last one. - Summary by Wikipedia and david
