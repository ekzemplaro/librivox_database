{"books":{"13":{"id":"8193","title":"Revolution, and other Essays","description":"A collection of 13 essays written between 1900 and 1908, published in 1910. The lead essay, \"Revolution\", outlines how and why London renounced capitalism as a failed social system and declared himself an active participant in the \"socialist revolution\", the last essay is an autobiographical piece, and the essays in between are on diverse subjects. A few of the \u201cessays\u201d are actually humorous short fiction stories; others are serious, sometimes angry rants against capitalistic greed and political corruption. All of the pieces are thought-provoking and excellently written, though only loosely intellectual, highly opinionated, and rife with contradiction, as was London himself. -- Summary by Michele
