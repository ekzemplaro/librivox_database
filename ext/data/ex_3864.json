Reasoning men have also protested, and justly, against the conception that what a majority in numbers, or even (what is more compelling still) a unanimity of decision in a community may order, may not only be wrong but may be something which that community has no authority to order since, though it possesses a civil and temporal authority, it acts against that ultimate authority which is its own consciousness of right. Men may and do justly protest against the doctrine that a community is incapable of doing deliberate evil; it is as capable of such an action as is an individual. But men nowhere do or can deny that the community acting as it thinks right is ultimately sovereign: there is no alternative to so plain a truth.\u201d\n- Hilaire Belloc<p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/frenchrevolution00bellrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"36","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3864","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/french_revolution_1001_librivox\/french_revolution_1001_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-french-revolution-by-hilaire-belloc\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:59:38","totaltimesecs":25178,"authors":[{"id":"156","first_name":"Hilaire","last_name":"Belloc","dob":"1870","dod":"1953"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/french_revolution_1001_librivox","sections":[{"id":"22309","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
