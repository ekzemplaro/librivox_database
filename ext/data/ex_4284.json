But he spends more than two decades in isolation before acquiring a sidekick \u2013 the man Friday you\u2019ve probably heard of. And who would guess his way to salvation would depend on leading a last-ditch fight against a shipful of mutineers?<br><br>For other castaway stories inspired by \u201cRobinson Crusoe\u201d, listen to \u201cThe Swiss Family Robinson\u201d (http:\/\/snipurl.com\/swiss_family) and \u201cThe Mysterious Island\u201d (http:\/\/snipurl.com\/mysterious_island).
