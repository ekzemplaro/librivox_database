{"books":{"11":{"id":"10075","title":"Cottage Poems","description":"Patrick Bront\u00eb (father of the famous Bront\u00eb sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anna) is mainly remembered as a father, reverend and teacher, but he also was a poet. <br><br>In <i>Cottage Poems<\/i>, his only published work, he gives gentle spiritual advice and guidance to the community, colleagues and members of his congregation in the form of lyrical letters. Even if one is simply interested in his daughters' works, it is still interesting to see where the sisters' inspiration to write may have come from.
