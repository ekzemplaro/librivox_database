{"books":{"15":{"id":"9349","title":"True Bear Stories","description":"Joaquin Miller dedicated this book to \"my dear little daughter...for whose pleasure and instruction I have many times dug up the most of these stories from out the days of my boyhood.\" In his preface he claims to prefer true stories to made-up ones. And he always defends bears, which he thinks have gotten an undeserved bad reputation from the general populous.\n\nMiller strives here to pass on a respect for the variety and wisdom in the lives of real bears. But perhaps we should offer one caution: throughout his life Joaquin Miller gained a reputation for being a supreme liar!
