{"books":{"6":{"id":"9576","title":"Tales of the Fish Patrol","description":"Wildest among the fisher-folk may be accounted the Chinese\nshrimp-catchers. It is the habit of the shrimp to crawl along the\nbottom in vast armies till it reaches fresh water, when it turns about\nand crawls back again to the salt. And where the tide ebbs and flows,\nthe Chinese sink great bag-nets to the bottom, with gaping mouths, into\nwhich the shrimp crawls and from which it is transferred to the\nboiling-pot. This in itself would not be bad, were it not for the small\nmesh of the nets, so small that the tiniest fishes, little new-hatched\nthings not a quarter of an inch long, cannot pass through. The beautiful\nbeaches of Points Pedro and Pablo, where are the shrimp-catchers\nvillages, are made fearful by the stench from myriads of decaying fish,\nand against this wasteful destruction it has ever been the duty of the\nfish patrol to act.These stories are set in the waterways around San Francisco Bay and involve the fish patrol with a variety of characters of different ethnicity and cultural backgrounds.  - Summary by Description from the opening of \"White and Yellow\" by J","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/28693","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"7","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9576","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"143","first_name":"Jack","last_name":"London","dob":"1876","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"330209","section_number":"1","title":"White and Yellow","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/fishpatrol_01_london.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5304","display_name":"Don W.
