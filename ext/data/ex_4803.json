{"books":{"28":{"id":"4803","title":"How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York","description":"<i>How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York<\/i> (1890) was a pioneering work of photojournalism by Jacob Riis, documenting the squalid living conditions in New York City slums in the 1880s. It served as a basis for future muckraking journalism by exposing the slums to New York City\u2019s upper and middle class. The title of the book is a reference to a phrase of Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, who wrote in <i>Pantagruel<\/i>: \"one half of the world does not know how the other half lives\".
