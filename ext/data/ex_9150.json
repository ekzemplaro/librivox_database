{"books":{"22":{"id":"9150","title":"Masters of Space","description":"This is the story of talking at a distance, of sending messages through space. It is the story of great men\u2014Morse, Thomson, Bell, Marconi, and others\u2014and how, with the aid of men like Field, Vail, Catty, Pupin, the scientist, and others in both the technical and commercial fields, they succeeded in flashing both messages and speech around the world, with wires and without wires. It is the story of how the thought of the world has been linked together by those modern wonders of science and of industry\u2014the telegraph, the submarine cable, the telephone, the wireless telegraph, and, most recently, the wireless telephone.
