{"books":{"17":{"id":"10627","title":"Pagan Papers","description":"We join our thoughtful author on a dreamy stroll at dusk through the English countryside, and listen to his nonchalant, slightly scattered musings on the human condition. What to do about relatives who are in the way? What is the proper punishment for a bookbinder who takes too long at his job? Are free libraries an unmixed blessing? Can nothing make it worth our while not to quarrel with our fellows? Which is more desirable: memory or forgetfulness? Are we irrevocably cut off from the natural world, or might there still be a way back to it? All these questions, and more, are explored within. Published in 1898, this collection of essays was Kenneth Grahame's first complied work. His wry and witty humor and examination of life, which would later be celebrated in his famous novel, The Wind in the Willows, shines through here.  - Summary by Mary Kay and Goodreads","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5319","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10627","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1222","first_name":"Kenneth","last_name":"Grahame","dob":"1859","dod":"1932"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"362196","section_number":"1","title":"The Romance of the Road","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_01_grahame_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10508","display_name":"Will Cooper"}]},{"id":"362197","section_number":"2","title":"The Romance of the Rail","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_02_grahame_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10508","display_name":"Will Cooper"}]},{"id":"362198","section_number":"3","title":"Non Libri Sed Liberi","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_03_grahame_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10481","display_name":"JudyDerby"}]},{"id":"362199","section_number":"4","title":"Loafing","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_04_grahame-128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10481","display_name":"JudyDerby"}]},{"id":"362200","section_number":"5","title":"Cheap Knowledge","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_05_grahame-128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"362201","section_number":"6","title":"The Rural Pan: An April Essay","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"362202","section_number":"7","title":"Marginalia","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"362203","section_number":"8","title":"The Eternal Whither","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"362211","section_number":"9","title":"Deus Terminus","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_09_grahame_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10402","display_name":"Brian Darby"}]},{"id":"362204","section_number":"10","title":"Of Smoking","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10813","display_name":"Kyle Alexander"}]},{"id":"362205","section_number":"11","title":"An Autumn Encounter","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_11_grahame-128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10634","display_name":"Fenman"}]},{"id":"362206","section_number":"12","title":"The White Poppy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_12_grahame-128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"362207","section_number":"13","title":"A Bohemian in Exile: A Reminiscence","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"362208","section_number":"14","title":"Justifiable Homicide","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kathrinee\/paganpapers_14_grahame_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10643","display_name":"Alimay"}]},{"id":"362209","section_number":"15","title":"The Fairy Wicket","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"362210","section_number":"16","title":"Aboard the Galley","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"362212","section_number":"17","title":"The Lost Centaur","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"362213","section_number":"18","title":"Orion","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10481","display_name":"JudyDerby"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"84","name":"Essays & Short Works"},{"id":"89","name":"Humor"}],"translators":[]}}}
