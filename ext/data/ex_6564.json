{"books":{"34":{"id":"6564","title":"Favor of Kings","description":"\"Never have bright romance and black scandal been more attached to the name of lovely woman,\" writes a quaint and susceptible chronicler, \" than to that of fair Anne Boleyn.\" Certainly no girl ever flashed so meteor-like above the satellites of an English court, and no woman ever went to her doom under more awful accusations. Since fiction could not be half so amazing as the facts of Anne Boleyn's story, I have kept this novel of her fortunes true to those facts, and have gone, for their knowledge, not only to the histories written of this period, but in many cases to the sources of those histories. My endeavor has been to reveal the actual characters and the actual situations, and to use as much of the real incident and dialogue as possible.\" (Summary by The author (see
