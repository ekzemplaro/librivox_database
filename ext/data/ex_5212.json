{"books":{"11":{"id":"5212","title":"Man Who Fought the Devil","description":"Jean Marie Vianney always found it hard to learn. In fact, he made history by receiving a zero as his examination mark after his first year of study in the seminary. But with determination, and with God\u2019s help, he won through. He became a hard-working parish priest and then a pastor \u2013 the beloved Cure of Ars.<br><br>Week by week, year by year, his fame as an advisor and a confessor grew. People flocked from great distances to his little church, and privately, among themselves, they called him \u201csaint\u201d. The devil, furious at the ever-increasing number of souls being saved by the Cure, tempted and taunted the priest and even persecuted him physically. But Satan found he had met his match.<br><br>Eva K. Betz was a prolific catholic writer of biographical and historical books for children.
