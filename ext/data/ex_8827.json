{"books":{"22":{"id":"8827","title":"Boy Crusoe","description":"A 15 year old hard working and studious farm boy finds the lure of adventure on the seas as a merchant seaman more than he can resist.  This is his story. \" I was born in a little town in the State of Maine, near the close of the Civil War. My boyhood life did not differ materially from that of the average farmer's son in the remote country districts of New England--except, perhaps, that I read more and thought more. Hard work on the rugged soil, two terms each year in the little yellow country schoolhouse, a day's fishing now and then filled the early years of my life full to over-flowing. \"  What he gets is enough excitement and adventure to overflow his wildest dreams.  How he experiences disaster and uses his wits and knowledge to overcome every problem makes for a great read.   - Summary by Phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/45397","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8827","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10519","first_name":"Allan","last_name":"Eric","dob":"?","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"309957","section_number":"1","title":"Early Life;
