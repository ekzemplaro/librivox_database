{"books":{"21":{"id":"10618","title":"Pitt","description":"Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, liberal prime minister (1894-1895), wrote this short biography of William Pitt, the Younger (1759-1806), the controversial young prime minister who led Great Britain during the terrible trial of the  Napoleonic Wars. Lord Rosebery writes: \"From the dead eighteenth century his figure still faces us with a majesty of loneliness and courage. There may have been men both abler and greater than he, though it is not easy to cite them; but in all history there is no more patriotic spirit, none more intrepid, and none more pure.\" - Summary by
