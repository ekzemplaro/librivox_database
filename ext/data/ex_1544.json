{"books":{"47":{"id":"1544","title":"What's Wrong With the World","description":"Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874\u20131936) has been called the \u201cprince of paradox.\u201d Time magazine observed of his writing style: \u201cWhenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories\u2014first carefully turning them inside out.\u201d His prolific and diverse output included journalism, philosophy, poetry, biography, Christian apologetics, fantasy and detective fiction.<br \/><br \/>The title of Chesteron\u2019s 1910 collection of essays was inspired by a title given to him two years earlier by The Times newspaper, which had asked a number of authors to write on the topic: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the world?\u201d. Chesterton\u2019s answer at that time was the shortest of those submitted - he simply wrote: \u201cDear Sirs, I am. Sincerely yours, G.K. Chesterton\u201d. In this collection he gives a fuller treatment of the question, with his characteristic conservative wit.
