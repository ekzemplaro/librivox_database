He arrived in Australia in 1878, and became a freelance journalist and writer in both Melbourne and Sydney. He is notable for becoming the first author in Australia who tried to earn a living from writing alone. In Sydney in 1898, he founded the bohemian Dawn and Dusk Club, which had many notable members such as writer Henry Lawson. He died at Sydney of tuberculosis.<\/p>\n\nHe used the pseudonym Creeve Roe (Irish =Red Branch - the area next to the Navan where Cu Chulainn trained as a Red Branch Knight), as well as his own name. His Poems (1908) and other collections were published posthumously. - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/atdawnanddusk00daleuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1898","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10103","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/picture_1507.poem_librivox\/picture_1507.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-picture-by-victor-daley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:13:27","totaltimesecs":807,"authors":[{"id":"10503","first_name":"Victor","last_name":"Daley","dob":"1858","dod":"1905"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/picture_1507.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"346612","section_number":"1","title":"A Picture - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"55","file_name":"picture_daley_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"346613","section_number":"2","title":"A Picture - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"69","file_name":"picture_daley_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"346617","section_number":"3","title":"A Picture - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"60","file_name":"picture_daley_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"346618","section_number":"4","title":"A Picture - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":"picture_daley_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"346621","section_number":"5","title":"A Picture - Read by GB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_gb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":"picture_daley_gb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"346620","section_number":"6","title":"A Picture - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":"picture_daley_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"346619","section_number":"7","title":"A Picture - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"67","file_name":"picture_daley_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"346614","section_number":"8","title":"A Picture - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"59","file_name":"picture_daley_lah_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"346623","section_number":"9","title":"A Picture - Read by LCW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_lcw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"60","file_name":"picture_daley_lcw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"346615","section_number":"10","title":"A Picture - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"67","file_name":"picture_daley_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"346622","section_number":"11","title":"A Picture - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":"picture_daley_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"346616","section_number":"12","title":"A Picture - Read by RP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_rp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"55","file_name":"picture_daley_rp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10200","display_name":"SciE"}]},{"id":"346624","section_number":"13","title":"A Picture - Read by SABT","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/picture_daley_sabt_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":"picture_daley_sabt_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8932","display_name":"SkyAlbatross"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
