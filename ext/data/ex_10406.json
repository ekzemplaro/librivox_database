{"books":{"6":{"id":"10406","title":"ISLAND NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS","description":"A marvelous depiction of two sides of South Sea Islands' life through three separate tales.  One, the experience of the incoming British keen to live free and exploit the innocent; the other the supernatural as perceived by Stevenson working in the lives of the natives.  One tale carries the germ of the story of Madame Butterfly, since become a part of Western culture.  Another is an extraordinary retelling of a German horror story transposed to a South Sea Island setting.  The last is an effort of the pure Stevensonian imagination and there can be nothing better.    - Summary by TONY ADDISON","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/329","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"7","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10406","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Island_Nights'_Entertainments","url_librivox":"https:\/\/forum.librivox.org\/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=58775","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"115","first_name":"Robert Louis","last_name":"Stevenson","dob":"1850","dod":"1894"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"356120","section_number":"1","title":"The Beach of Falesa.
