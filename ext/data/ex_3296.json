{"books":{"3":{"id":"3296","title":"Four Dramatic Monologues","description":"<p>Robert Browning (1812-1889) was one of the most prolific and influential of English poets. Many of his best-known poems are dramatic monologues in which characters expound their views without overt comment by the author. Often the monologues surreptitiously reveal truths that their narrators fail to realize or would prefer to conceal.<br \/>This recording collects Browning\u2019s four dramatic monologues that depict characters of the first centuries B.C.E. and C.E. The first two, An Epistle Containing the Strange Medical Experience of Karshish, the Arab Physician, and Cleon (both published in Men and Women, 1855), were clearly written as companion pieces. Over thirty years later, Browning added another poem to the group: \u201cImperante Augusto Natus Est -\u201d (published in Asolando, 1889). The speakers of these three monologues are, respectively, an Arab physician, a Greek poet, and a Roman senator - all of them fictional characters invented by Browning himself. The much larger poem A Death in the Desert (published in Dramatis Personae, 1864) is in effect a triple monologue, in which the remarks of a quirkily pedantic ancient commentator frame a narrative by a disciple of the apostle John, which in turn frames the dying words of John himself.
