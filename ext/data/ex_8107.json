{"books":{"13":{"id":"8107","title":"Dallam's Travels with an Organ to the Grand Signieur, 1599-1600","description":"Queen Elizabeth the First of England,  the Grand Turk at Constantinople, and  an organ builder named Thomas Dallam\u2014quite a trio.  In 1599, Elizabeth commanded master organ builder Dallam to construct and deliver to the Grand Signieur , as a present intended to garner trade and political advantages for England, a fantastic mechanical organ.  Dallam\u2019s wonder stood 16 feet high and was topped by  a silver  holly bush filled with blackbirds and thrushes that sung and shook their wings.   Dallam kept a diary during his visit to Turkey, which included a sneak look through a grate at the Grand Turk\u2019s concubines in the harem.  \u201cI stood so long looking upon them that (the guide) stamped with his foot to make me give over looking; the which I was very loath to do, for that sight did please me wondrous well.\u201d  Dallam\u2019s ingenuous style and numerous adventures make for a highly enjoyable listen.  -
