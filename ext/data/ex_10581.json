{"books":{"11":{"id":"10581","title":"Stories of Enchantment","description":"Jane Pentzer Myers's only book was dedicated to Kate Winifred: 'Just between the 'Land o' dreams' and broad daylight is a beautiful world, where good wishes come true: where the poor and lonely are rich in castles and friends: and where sorrowful folk are happy.' These twelve charming tales transport us to that wonderful land of dreams and delight and enchant children of all ages.
