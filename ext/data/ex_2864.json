{"books":{"21":{"id":"2864","title":"New Organon Or True Directions Concerning The Interpretation of Nature","description":"The Novum Organum is a philosophical work by Francis Bacon published in 1620. The title translates as \"new instrument\". This is a reference to Aristotle's work Organon, which was his treatise on logic and syllogism. In Novum Organum, Bacon details a new system of logic he believes to be superior to the old ways of syllogism. For Bacon, finding the essence of a thing was a simple process of reduction, and the use of inductive reasoning . . . This work was critical in the historical development of the scientific method.
