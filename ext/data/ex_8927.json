{"books":{"12":{"id":"8927","title":"Psychology of Alcoholism","description":"....\"\nTurning now, for a moment, to the more practical \nside of this investigation, it is no surprise to find that \nthe suggestions looking toward the relief of the \nsufferer from alcoholism are almost entirely of the \npsychological order. General sanitation is, without \ndoubt, here as everywhere else in the field of patho- \nlogical conditions, of great and indisputable value. \nBut it is doubtful whether the beneficial effect of \nadministering drugs is not chiefly, if not even wholly, \ndue to their psychological rather than to their primarily \nphysiological value. Almost certainly the same must \nbe said \u2014 and said a fortiori \u2014 of all hypnotic practice \nin the case of alcoholic patients. And, really, from \nevery point of view, theoretical and practical, physio- \nlogical and psychological, the most interesting and \nastonishing of all the phenomena are those connected \nwith the cure of alcoholism by religious conversion. \nThe indubitable facts of experience upon which \nDr. Cutten dwells in some of these chapters, and \nwhich show the remarkable results that follow from \nabrupt and decided changes in the life of feeling \nthrough religious ideas and influences, are deserving \nof an even more detailed and critical treatment than \nhe has been able to give them in this book. The \nconfessions and actual performances of reformed \nalcoholic debauchees require, and are worthy of, a \nmuch more thorough discussion from the point of \nview of psychology, and by the methods of the \ntrained psychologist, than they have as yet ever \nreceived. \" Summary by GEORGE TRUMBULL LADD from Introductory Preface  ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/psychologyofalco00cutt","language":"English","copyright_year":"1907","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8927","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10598","first_name":"George Barton","last_name":"Cutten","dob":"1874","dod":"1962"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"312822","section_number":"1","title":"Preface & Chapter I - Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/psychologyofalcoholism_01_cutten_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312823","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II - Physiology","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/psychologyofalcoholism_02_cutten_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312824","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III - Memory","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/psychologyofalcoholism_03_cutten_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312825","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV - Intellect (not including memory)","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/psychologyofalcoholism_04_cutten_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312826","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter V - Will","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/psychologyofalcoholism_05_cutten_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312827","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter VI - Emotions","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/psychologyofalcoholism_06_cutten_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312828","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter VII - Senses","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/psychologyofalcoholism_07_cutten_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312829","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter VIII - Morals","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312830","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter IX - Insanity","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312831","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter X - Religious Conversion as a Cure","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312832","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XI - Hypnotism and Other Cures","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312833","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]},{"id":"312834","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9122","display_name":"Curt Walton"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"100","name":"Psychology"}],"translators":[]}}}
