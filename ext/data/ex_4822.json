Our kings and queens have all to obey Judge Grammar\u2019s laws, or else they would talk what is called bad grammar; and then, even their own subjects would laugh at them, and would say: \u201cPoor things! <\/p><p>They are funny fellows, these nine Parts-of-Speech. You will find out by-and-by which you like best amongst them all.
