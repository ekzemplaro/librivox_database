{"books":{"73":{"id":"8576","title":"Mysteries of London Part 2","description":"The Mysteries of London was a best-selling novel in mid-Victorian England. The first series was published in weekly instalments from 1844-46, priced at a penny each. Serialised novels sold in this way were known as Penny Dreadfuls \u2026 without any claim to literary greatness, they sought to provide ongoing entertainment for the popular audience.\n\nWhen first published, this book was intended for an adult audience. The crime and vice involved would have had a terrible effect on the Young Mind of the Victorian Era. However, it\u2019s less likely to cause offence or concern now, though I don\u2019t recommend it for younger children. - Summary by Cori","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.victorianlondon.org\/mysteries\/mysteries-00-chapters.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1844","num_sections":"74","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8576","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Mysteries_of_London","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4796","first_name":" George W.
