{"books":{"10":{"id":"10018","title":"Life of St. Ignatius of Loyola","description":"Saint Ignatius of Loyola (1491\u2013 1556) was a Spanish knight from a local Basque noble family, hermit, priest since 1537, and theologian, who founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and was its first Superior General. After being seriously wounded in the Battle of Pamplona in 1521, he underwent a spiritual conversion while in recovery. De Vita Christi by Ludolph of Saxony purportedly inspired Loyola to abandon his previous military life and devote himself to labour for God. He died in July 1556, was beatified by Pope Paul V in 1609, canonized by Pope Gregory XV in 1622, and declared patron of all spiritual retreats by Pope Pius XI in 1922.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.heritage-history.com\/index.php?c=read&author=forbes&book=ignatius&story=_front","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10018","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/lifeofstignatius_1602_librivox\/lifeofstignatius_1602_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ignatius_of_Loyola","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-life-of-st-ignatius-of-loyola-by-frances-alice-forbes\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:14:53","totaltimesecs":8093,"authors":[{"id":"3580","first_name":"Frances Alice","last_name":"Forbes","dob":"1869","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lifeofstignatius_1602_librivox","sections":[{"id":"344390","section_number":"1","title":"Pamplona - and After","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_01_forbes_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"760","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_01_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"344391","section_number":"2","title":"The  Battlefield","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_02_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"599","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_02_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9976","display_name":"Fred Abboud"}]},{"id":"344392","section_number":"3","title":"The Forging of Weapons","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_03_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"730","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_03_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9976","display_name":"Fred Abboud"}]},{"id":"344393","section_number":"4","title":"Jerusalem","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_04_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"809","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_04_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9976","display_name":"Fred Abboud"}]},{"id":"344394","section_number":"5","title":"In the King's Service","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_05_forbes_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"621","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_05_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"344395","section_number":"6","title":"The 'Free Company'","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_06_forbes_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"682","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_06_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"344396","section_number":"7","title":"The Warfare","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_07_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"880","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_07_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9976","display_name":"Fred Abboud"}]},{"id":"344397","section_number":"8","title":"The General and His Army","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_08_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"956","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_08_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9976","display_name":"Fred Abboud"}]},{"id":"344398","section_number":"9","title":"'Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam'","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_09_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"590","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_09_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5338","display_name":"S R Colon"}]},{"id":"344399","section_number":"10","title":"The Last Fight","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstingnatius_10_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"777","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_10_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5338","display_name":"S R Colon"}]},{"id":"344400","section_number":"11","title":"The Legacy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofstignatius_11_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"689","file_name":"lifeofstignatius_11_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10230","display_name":"toadoftoadhall"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"},{"id":"129","name":"Christianity - Biographies"}],"translators":[]}}}
