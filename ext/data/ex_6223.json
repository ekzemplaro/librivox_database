Presenting Marco Polo as an important figure at the court of the Mongol leader Kublai Khan, the book was written in Old French by Rustichello da Pisa, a romance author of the time, who was reportedly working from accounts which he had heard from Marco Polo when they were imprisoned in Genoa, having been captured while on a ship.<br><br>This audiobook in two volumes uses the 1903 third edition of Sir Henry Yule's translation, revised by Henri Cordier.
