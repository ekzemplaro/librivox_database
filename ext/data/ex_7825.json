{"books":{"17":{"id":"7825","title":"Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals","description":"<br \/>David Hume, an eminent Scottish philosopher, historian, and essayist, explores the nature and foundation of Morals in this book, which was written as a popular summary of Book III in A Treatise of Human Nature. Hume states: \u201cThere has been a controversy started of late, much better worth examination, concerning the general foundation of Morals; whether they be derived from Reason, or from Sentiment; whether we attain the knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction, or by an immediate feeling and finer internal sense; whether, like all sound judgement of truth and falsehood, they should be the same to every rational intelligent being; or whether, like the perception of beauty and deformity, they be founded entirely on the particular fabric and constitution of the human species.\u201d (Excerpted from Section I \u2013 Of the General Principles of Morals) (Summary from the text and adapted from Wikipedia by lubee930) <br \/><br \/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4320","language":"English","copyright_year":"1751","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7825","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/enquirymorals_1310_librivox\/enquirymorals_1310_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/An_Enquiry_Concerning_the_Principles_of_Morals","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/enquiry-principles-morals-by-david-hume\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"05:46:02","totaltimesecs":20762,"authors":[{"id":"70","first_name":"David","last_name":"Hume","dob":"1711","dod":"1776"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/enquirymorals_1310_librivox","sections":[{"id":"283121","section_number":"1","title":"Section I.
