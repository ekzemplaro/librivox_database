{"books":{"29":{"id":"8489","title":"Sea Stories","description":"Most of us have passed through a period of life during which we have ardently longed to be, if not actually a rover, a buccaneer, or a pirate, at least and really a sailor! To run away to sea has been the misdirected ambition of many a youngster, and some lads there are who have realized their desire to their sorrow. The boy who has not cherished in his heart and exhibited in his actions at sometime or other during his youthful days, a love of ships and salt water, is fit for\u2014well, he is fit for the shore, and that is the worst thing a sailor could say about him!
