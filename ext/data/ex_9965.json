{"books":{"11":{"id":"9965","title":"Master of Ballantrae","description":"Heir to a noble Scottish house in the mid 18th century, the Master is a charming, clever, and resourceful villain whose daring but ill-advised schemes first alienate his patrimony and at last cost him his life.  His younger brother, sweet-tempered and good but dull and unpopular, suffers at his brother\u2019s hands until his patience and courage win him limited ascendancy, but he is at last consumed with hatred and driven to madness and death by the strain of his many sufferings.  The story is told from the point of view of a loyal servant with occasional documents in the words of other eye-witnesses.  The episodic plot, although exciting, serves mainly as a structure on which to hang superb character studies.  The Master, whom one both admires and hates, can be compared with Long John Silver.  The secondary characters, the father and the wife, undergo remarkable but credible transformations, and (with the exception of the two children) even the very minor characters are deftly characterized.

Copeland)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30939","language":"English","copyright_year":"1912","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9965","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Master_of_Ballantrae","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"115","first_name":"Robert Louis","last_name":"Stevenson","dob":"1850","dod":"1894"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"342754","section_number":"0","title":"Dedication & Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/ballantrae_0_stevenson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6249","display_name":"Thomas A.
