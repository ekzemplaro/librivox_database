{"books":{"18":{"id":"1250","title":"Zadig or the Book of Fate","description":"Zadig, ou La Destin\u00e9e, (\"Zadig, or The Book of Fate\") (1747) is a famous novel written by the French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire. It tells the story of Zadig, a philosopher in ancient Babylonia. The author does not attempt any historical accuracy, and some of the problems Zadig faces are thinly disguised references to social and political problems of Voltaire's own day.<br \/><br \/>The book is philosophical in nature, and presents human life as in the hands of a destiny beyond human control. It is a story of religious and metaphysical orthodoxy, both of which Voltaire challenges with his presentation of the moral revolution taking place in Zadig himself. Voltaire's skillful use of the literary devices of contradiction and juxtaposition are shown in beautiful form in this prose. Behind Candide, it is considered one of his most celebrated works.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/18972\/18972-h\/18972-h.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1749","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1250","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/zadig_0801_librivox\/zadig_0801_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zadig","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/zadig-or-the-book-of-fate-by-voltaire\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:47:00","totaltimesecs":13620,"authors":[{"id":"4298","first_name":"","last_name":"Voltaire","dob":"1694","dod":"1778"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/zadig_0801_librivox","sections":[{"id":"141703","section_number":"0","title":"Front Matter","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"319","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"141704","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"573","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"141705","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"367","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]},{"id":"141706","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"798","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"141707","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"798","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"141708","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"394","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1618","display_name":"Nicholas James Bridgewater"}]},{"id":"141709","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"588","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1579","display_name":"Philippa Willitts"}]},{"id":"141710","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"828","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1618","display_name":"Nicholas James Bridgewater"}]},{"id":"141711","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"557","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1618","display_name":"Nicholas James Bridgewater"}]},{"id":"141712","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"560","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"141713","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"456","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1603","display_name":"Arouet"}]},{"id":"141714","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"726","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2262","display_name":"Andy"}]},{"id":"141715","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"775","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1572","display_name":"Alan Clare"}]},{"id":"141716","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"659","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2262","display_name":"Andy"}]},{"id":"141717","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 14","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"664","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2262","display_name":"Andy"}]},{"id":"141718","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter 15","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1858","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1572","display_name":"Alan Clare"}]},{"id":"141719","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter 16","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"870","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1992","display_name":"Michelle White"}]},{"id":"141720","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter 17","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1134","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"141721","section_number":"18","title":"Chapter 18","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"696","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"296","display_name":"Carl Manchester"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"29","name":"Satire"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"}],"translators":[{"id":"221","first_name":"","last_name":"Unknown","dob":"","dod":""}]}}}
