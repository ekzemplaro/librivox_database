{"books":{"24":{"id":"1084","title":"Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson","description":"<p>Emily Dickinson has come to be regarded as one of the quintessential poets of 19th century America. A very private poet with a very quiet and reclusive life, her poetry was published posthumously and immediately found a wide audience. <p>While she echoed the romantic natural themes of her times, her style was much more free and irregular, causing many to criticize her and editors to \"correct\" her. In the early 20th century, when poetic style had become much looser, new audiences learned to appreciate her work. Here collected are many of her most contemplative, most rebellious, and \"dark\" works, expressing her frustrations with the behavioral confines of her times, and the confines of being human and unknowing of eternity.
