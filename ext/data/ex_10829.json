Two of Shakespeare's most famous sonnets, Sonnet 18 and Sonnet 130, have completely contradict each-other and offer differing views on love and love poetry. Whereas Sonnet 18 is the nice cute cliched one, Sonnet 130 provides a more realistic, almost rhetorical view of love and both would be incredibly popular. This project features Sonnet 18. - Summary by catrose ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1041","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10829","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/sonnet_18_1604.poem_librivox\/sonnet_18_1604.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shakespeare's_sonnets","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/sonnet-18-by-william-shakespeare-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:18:09","totaltimesecs":1089,"authors":[{"id":"37","first_name":"William","last_name":"Shakespeare","dob":"1554","dod":"1616"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/sonnet_18_1604.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"368351","section_number":"1","title":"Sonnet 18 -
