Generally, dhamma can refer to the Buddha's \"doctrine\" or an \"eternal truth\" or \"righteousness\" or all \"phenomena\";and, at its root, pada means \"foot\" and thus by extension, especially in this context, means either \"path\" or \"verse\" or both. - Summary by Summarized from text in the Wikipedia by Jothi Tharavan","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2017","language":"English","copyright_year":"1881","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9485","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dhammapada","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"221","first_name":"","last_name":"Unknown","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"327872","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I.
