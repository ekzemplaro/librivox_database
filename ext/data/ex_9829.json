{"books":{"10":{"id":"9829","title":"Death-bed","description":"Thomas Hood  was an English poet, author, and humourist, best known for poems such as The Bridge of Sighs and The Song of the Shirt. Hood wrote regularly for The London Magazine, the Athenaeum, and Punch. He later published a magazine largely consisting of his own works. Hood, never robust, lapsed into invalidism by the age of 41 and died at the age of 45. William Michael Rossetti in 1903 called him \"the finest English poet\" between the generations of Shelley and Tennyson. - Summary by Wikipadia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/101\/","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9829","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/the_death-bed_1504.poem_librivox\/the_death-bed_1504.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-death-bed-by-thomas-hood\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:11:53","totaltimesecs":713,"authors":[{"id":"715","first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Hood","dob":"1799","dod":"1845"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/the_death-bed_1504.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"338102","section_number":"1","title":"The Death-bed - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/deathbed_hood_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"62","file_name":"deathbed_hood_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"338104","section_number":"2","title":"The Death-bed - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/deathbed_hood_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"70","file_name":"deathbed_hood_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"338100","section_number":"3","title":"The Death-bed - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/deathbed_hood_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"48","file_name":"deathbed_hood_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"338106","section_number":"4","title":"The Death-bed - Read by GB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/deathbed_hood_gb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"69","file_name":"deathbed_hood_gb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"338107","section_number":"5","title":"The Death-bed - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/deathbed_hood_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":"deathbed_hood_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"338103","section_number":"6","title":"The Death-bed - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/deathbed_hood_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"58","file_name":"deathbed_hood_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
