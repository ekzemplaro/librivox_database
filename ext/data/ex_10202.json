{"books":{"41":{"id":"10202","title":"Three Minute Stories","description":"This is a delightful collection of little stories for little people, just right to be listened to at bed time by a sleepy boy or girl.   Some have a moral, some are just fun and some are poems; but all of them are either written or adapted by the well known author Laura  Richards.   These bite sized stories are also just right for beginning readers for LibriVox who might want something short to learn about recording and editing.  In any case they are all sweetly reminiscent of by gone days when life seemed simpler and easier for adults and children.   - Summary by Phil
