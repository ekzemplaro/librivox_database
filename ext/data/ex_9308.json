{"books":{"14":{"id":"9308","title":"Sunbonnet Babies in Italy","description":"\"See that smoking mountain, Molly! Look! I believe it is a volcano. It is Mount Vesuvius. Yes, I know it is Mount Vesuvius!\"\nMay, the Sunbonnet Baby, was talking with Molly, her little Sunbonnet Baby sister. They were standing on the deck of a great ocean steamer. They had been sailing on the steamer for days and days. They had sailed more than four thousand miles away from their home in America. Now they were almost at the end of their journey. They would very soon be in Italy.\"  This is of course another \"Sunbonnet Baby\" book that takes Mary and her little sister Molly on a tour of Italy.  It is meant to give children a taste of the marvels of the Italian pennunsula, visiting Sicily, Rome, Capri, Naples, the country side, and many other wonderful cities and towns.    - Summary by Phil
