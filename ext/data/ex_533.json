{"books":{"20":{"id":"533","title":"Current Superstitions","description":"<p>No matter how enlightened, chances are you've been raised around superstitious lore of one kind or another. Fanny Dickerson Bergen was one of the original researchers of North American oral traditions relating to such key life events and experiences as babyhood and childhood, marriage, wishes and dreams, luck, warts and cures, death omens and mortuary customs, and \"such truck,\" as Huck Finn would say.<\/p><p>You'll be surprised at how many of these old saws you'll know. Here's a quote from Chapter One, Babyhood:<\/p><p>Monday\u2019s child is fair of face,<br \/>Tuesday\u2019s child is full of grace,<br \/>Wednesday\u2019s child is sour and sad,<br \/>Thursday\u2019s child is merry and glad,<br \/>Friday\u2019s child is loving and giving,<br \/>Saturday\u2019s child must work for a living;<br \/>But the child that is born on the Sabbath day<br \/>Is blithe and bonny, good and gay.<br \/>--Baldwinsville, N. Y.<\/p><p>All of these readings are as short as 5 minutes and no longer than 15 minutes, with plenty of pithy one-liners in the form of proverbs, always given with the locale they came from in Canada or the United States (with clear influences in British tradition).
