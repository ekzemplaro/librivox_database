{"books":{"22":{"id":"1460","title":"Grandma Janice's Poems and Stories","description":"The poems and stories in this collection were selected with the reader\u2019s grandchildren in mind. \u201cThe Raggedy Man\u201d and \u201cLittle Orphant Annie,\u201d both by James Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier Poet were favorites of the reader when she was a child on a farm in Indiana. Other favorites were picked up along the way as she read to her own daughter and to her students, while other gems were discovered while looking for poems and stories to include in this collection. It is hoped that this collection will bless the hearts of many children and parents alike as they listen together.<p>","url_text_source":"","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1460","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/grandma_janice_01_librivox\/grandma_janice_01_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/grandma-janices-poems-and-stories\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:18:12","totaltimesecs":4692,"authors":[{"id":"18","first_name":"","last_name":"Various","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/grandma_janice_01_librivox","sections":[{"id":"145417","section_number":"1","title":"Raggedy Man, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"300","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1856","display_name":"Janice Green"}]},{"id":"145418","section_number":"2","title":"Worm, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"49","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1856","display_name":"Janice Green"}]},{"id":"145419","section_number":"3","title":"My Shadow","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"81","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1856","display_name":"Janice Green"}]},{"id":"145420","section_number":"4","title":"Tale of Peter Rabbit, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"437","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1856","display_name":"Janice Green"}]},{"id":"145421","section_number":"5","title":"The Duel (The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat)","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"130","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1856","display_name":"Janice Green"}]},{"id":"145422","section_number":"6","title":"I\u2019m Nobody!
