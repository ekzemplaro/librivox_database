{"books":{"10":{"id":"7132","title":"Mintage","description":"Elbert Hubbard is best known as the author of the \"Little Journeys To The Homes of Famous People\". These 11 short stores show the side of him that celebrated caring, friendship love among humans. The first describes how 5 frightened orphan children from a foreign country were cared for on a railroad journey of a thousand miles; all by strangers without any planning and without a word of English being spoken or needed. He observed caring human men and women of all ages doing whatever was necessary to see they reached their destination in whatever comfort could be provided. His famous motto was \"The mintage of wisdom is to know that rest is rust and that real life lies in love, laughter and work\".
