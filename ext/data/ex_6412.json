{"books":{"11":{"id":"6412","title":"Ebb-Tide","description":"Three men down on their luck in Tahiti agree to ship out on a vessel whose officers have died of smallpox. Their desperate venture inspires them to a further idea: they will steal the schooner and its cargo of champagne, sell them, and live a plentiful life. The thought is intoxicating... and so is the cargo, which they sample. Inattention nearly brings them to grief in a sudden storm. This sobering experience is followed by another - apparently the dead officers had a similar ambition! - and their dreams of riches vanish.<br><br>Then, nearly out of provisions and deep in the heart of the Pacific where the chart shows no land - they happen on a small isle only hinted at in the records and never mapped. Saved! But what is this? The island hides a pearl fishery?<br><br>In the ebb-tide of fortune, what new villainy will the three attempt? (Summary by Mark F. Smith)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1604","language":"English","copyright_year":"1894","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6412","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ebbtide_1203_librivox\/ebbtide_1203_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Ebb-Tide","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-ebb-tide-by-robert-louis-stevenson-and-lloyd-osbourne\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:23:22","totaltimesecs":19402,"authors":[{"id":"2431","first_name":"Lloyd","last_name":"Osbourne","dob":"1868","dod":"1947"},{"id":"115","first_name":"Robert Louis","last_name":"Stevenson","dob":"1850","dod":"1894"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ebbtide_1203_librivox","sections":[{"id":"90455","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Night On the Beach","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1684","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"204","display_name":"Mark F.
