{"books":{"28":{"id":"8172","title":"Among the Meadow People","description":"Lovely book of nature written for children by teacher and naturalist Clara Dillingham Pierson. This book in the \"Among the People\" series explores the animal inhabitants of the meadow and garden. The charming prose shrinks us down and puts us in the fascinating world of the tiny insects, amphibians, and birds who call the field their home. From the author's Introduction: \"In selecting the tiny creatures of field and garden for the characters in this book, I have remembered with pleasure the way in which my six loyal pupils befriended stray crickets and grasshoppers, their intense appreciation of the new realm of fancy and observation, and the eagerness and attention with which they sought Mother Nature, the most wonderful and tireless of all story-tellers.\" - Summary by Clara Dillingham Pierson & Jill
