{"books":{"36":{"id":"5519","title":"Anecdotes of Dogs","description":"<br \/>\"Histories are more full of examples of the fidelity of dogs than of friends.\" <br \/><br \/>\nThe character, sensibilities, and intellectual faculties of animals have always been a favourite study, and they are, perhaps, more strongly developed in the dog than in any other quadruped, from the circumstance of his being the constant companion of man. I am aware how much has been written on this subject, but having accumulated many original and interesting anecdotes of this faithful animal, I have attempted to enlarge the general stock of information respecting it.<br \/><br \/>\n<br \/><br \/>It is a pleasing task, arising from the conviction that the more the character of the dog is known, the better his treatment is likely to be, and the stronger the sympathy excited in his behalf.\n(Summary by Edward Jesse, extracted from the Preface)<br \/><br \/>\n\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/26500","language":"English","copyright_year":"1846","num_sections":"37","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5519","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/anecdotes_dogs_1209_librivox\/anecdotes_dogs_1209_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/anecdotes-of-dogs-by-edward-jesse\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"13:30:35","totaltimesecs":48635,"authors":[{"id":"3338","first_name":"Edward","last_name":"Jesse","dob":"1780","dod":"1868"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/anecdotes_dogs_1209_librivox","sections":[{"id":"67197","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
