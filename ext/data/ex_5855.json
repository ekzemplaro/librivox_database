{"books":{"24":{"id":"5855","title":"Lure of the Labrador Wild","description":"The Lure Of The Labrador Wild is a account of a expedition by Leonidas Hubbard, an adventurer and journalist to canoe the system Naskaupi River - Lake Michikamau in Labrador and George River in Quebec. His companions on this journey were his friend, New York lawyer Dillon Wallace and an Indian guide from Missannabie, George Elson. From the start, the expedition was beset with mistakes and problems. Instead of ascending the Naskaupi River, by mistake they followed the shallow Susan Brook. After hard long portaging and almost reaching Lake Michikamau, with food supplies running out, on September 15 at Windbound lake, they decided to turn back. On October 18, Wallace and Elson went in a search of cached store of flour, leaving Hubbard behind in a tent. Hubbard died of exhaustion and starvation on either same or next day. Wallace got lost in the snowstorm, while Elson, after a week of bushwhacking, building raft to cross swollen rivers (with no ax), reached the nearest occupied cabin. A search party found Wallace alive on October 30, 1903.( Summary from Wikipedia )","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4019","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"25","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5855","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/lurelabradorwild_1110_librivox\/lurelabradorwild_1110_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-lure-of-the-labrador-wild-by-dillon-wallace\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:13:30","totaltimesecs":29610,"authors":[{"id":"2394","first_name":"Dillon","last_name":"Wallace","dob":"1863","dod":"1939"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/lurelabradorwild_1110_librivox","sections":[{"id":"75592","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
