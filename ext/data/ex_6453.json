{"books":{"13":{"id":"6453","title":"Valley of Vision","description":"\u201dWhy do you choose such a title as The Valley of Vision for your book\u201d said my friend; \u201cdo you mean that one can see farther from the valley than from the mountain-top?\u201d This question set me thinking, as every honest question ought to do. Here is the result of my thoughts, which you will take for what it is worth, if you care to read the book. The mountain-top is the place of outlook over the earth and the sea. But it is in the valley of suffering, endurance, and self-sacrifice that the deepest visions of the meaning of life come to us.\nI take the outcome of this Twentieth Century War as a victory over the mad illusion of world-domination which the Germans saw from the peak of their military power in 1914. The united force of the Allies has grown, through valley-visions of right and justice and human kindness, into an irresistible might before which the German \u201cwill to power\u201d has gone down in ruin.
