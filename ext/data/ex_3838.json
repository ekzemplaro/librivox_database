{"books":{"41":{"id":"3838","title":"Resurrection, Book 2","description":"<p>Resurrection is the last of Tolstoy's major fiction works published in his lifetime. Tolstoy intended the novel as an exposition of injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. It was first published serially in the magazine Niva as an effort to raise funds for the resettlement of the Dukhobors. The story concerns a nobleman named Nekhlyudov, who seeks redemption for a sin committed years earlier. His brief affair with a maid resulted in her being fired and ending up in prostitution. The book treats his attempts to help her out of her current misery, but also focuses on his personal mental and moral struggle.(Summary from Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1938","language":"English","copyright_year":"1899","num_sections":"42","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3838","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/resurrection_2_1002_librivox\/resurrection_2_1002_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/resurrection-book-2-by-leo-tolstoy\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:35:52","totaltimesecs":27352,"authors":[{"id":"217","first_name":"Leo","last_name":"Tolstoy","dob":"1828","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/resurrection_2_1002_librivox","sections":[{"id":"21399","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
