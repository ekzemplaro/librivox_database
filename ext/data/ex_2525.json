{"books":{"46":{"id":"2525","title":"Green Fairy Book","description":"<p>Andrew Lang's Fairy Books or Andrew Lang's \"Coloured\" Fairy Books constitute a twelve-book series of fairy tale collections. Although Andrew Lang did not collect the stories himself from the oral tradition, the extent of his sources, who had collected them originally (with the notable exception of Madame d'Aulnoy), made them an immensely influential collection, especially as he used foreign-language sources, giving many of these tales their first appearance in English. As acknowledged in the prefaces, although Lang himself made most of the selections, his wife and other translators did a large portion of the translating and telling of the actual stories.<br><br>\"The irony of Lang's life and work is that although he wrote for a profession\u2014literary criticism; fiction; poems; books and articles on anthropology, mythology, history, and travel ... he is best recognized for the works he did not write.\"[1]\n\nMany of the books were illustrated by Henry J. Ford, Lancelot Speed, and G. P. Jacomb-Hood also contributed some illustrations. <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/7277","language":"English","copyright_year":"1892","num_sections":"47","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2525","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/green_fairy_book_1012_librivox\/green_fairy_book_1012_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andrew_Lang's_Fairy_Books","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-green-fairy-book-by-andrew-lang\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"12:07:11","totaltimesecs":43631,"authors":[{"id":"90","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Lang","dob":"1844","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/green_fairy_book_1012_librivox","sections":[{"id":"4838","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"375","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5230","display_name":"Aubrey Anne"}]},{"id":"4839","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The Blue Bird Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1611","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5164","display_name":"Vsilverlining"}]},{"id":"4840","section_number":"2","title":"02 - The Blue Bird Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1446","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5164","display_name":"Vsilverlining"}]},{"id":"4841","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Half-Chick","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"506","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4667","display_name":"Maria Therese"}]},{"id":"4842","section_number":"4","title":"04 - The Story of Caliph Stork","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1289","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5635","display_name":"Matthew Reece"}]},{"id":"4843","section_number":"5","title":"05 - The Enchanted Watch","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"678","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4936","display_name":"jedopi"}]},{"id":"4844","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Rosanella","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"786","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5230","display_name":"Aubrey Anne"}]},{"id":"4845","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Sylvain and Jocosa","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"699","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3175","display_name":"frankcvo"}]},{"id":"4846","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Fairy Gifts","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"564","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4936","display_name":"jedopi"}]},{"id":"4847","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Prince Narcissus and the Princess Potentilla","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2236","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4015","display_name":"JimOCR"}]},{"id":"4848","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Prince Featherhead and the Princess Celandine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2006","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5290","display_name":"Natalie"}]},{"id":"4849","section_number":"11","title":"11 - The Three Little Pigs","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"636","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3698","display_name":"Nadine Eckert-Boulet"}]},{"id":"4850","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Heart of Ice Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1367","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4015","display_name":"JimOCR"}]},{"id":"4851","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Heart of Ice Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1251","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4015","display_name":"JimOCR"}]},{"id":"4852","section_number":"14","title":"14 - Heart of Ice Part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1775","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4015","display_name":"JimOCR"}]},{"id":"4853","section_number":"15","title":"15 - The Enchanted Ring","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1011","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4936","display_name":"jedopi"}]},{"id":"4854","section_number":"16","title":"16 - The Snuff-box","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"665","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"204","display_name":"Mark F.
