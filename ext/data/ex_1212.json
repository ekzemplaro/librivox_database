Born in Wales, he migrated over to the United States at the age of 18, he eventually became an overseas correspondent for the New York Herald. In 1869 Stanley was told by James Gordon Bennett Jr to find Livingstone, a scottish missionary and explorer. When Stanley commented on the cost Bennett's reply was:\n<em>\"Well, I will tell you what you will do. Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent, draw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE.\"<\/em>\nHow I Found Livingstone is Stanley's personnel account of his trip from Zanzibar to Lake Tanganyika on this quest, including time spent exploring the area with Livingstone.<\/p>\n\n<p>- Written by Lizzie Driver (Modified from Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/5157","language":"English","copyright_year":"1872","num_sections":"43","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1212","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/how_found_livingstone_0807_librivox\/how_found_livingstone_0807_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/how-i-found-livingstone-by-sir-henry-m-stanley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"16:57:59","totaltimesecs":61079,"authors":[{"id":"4438","first_name":" Henry Morton","last_name":"Stanley","dob":"1841","dod":"1904"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/how_found_livingstone_0807_librivox","sections":[{"id":"141177","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1 - INTRODUCTORY.
