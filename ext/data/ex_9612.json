{"books":{"36":{"id":"9612","title":"Sentimental Tommy","description":"\"J. M. Barrie is most noted for being the author of Peter Pan, the beloved book about a child who does not want to grow up. The two Tommy novels, as they are collectively referred to, are also about a child who does not want to grow up. Yet, unlike Peter Pan, he has to. Tommy grows up in the slums of London at the end of the 19th century in difficult conditions. This book explores his boyhood. How would his childhood fantasies collide with the hard conditions in which he lives and the reality of his growing up? The Tommy novels are considered semi-autobiographical.\"  - Summary by Stav Nisser.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/48066","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"37","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9612","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1860","first_name":"J.
