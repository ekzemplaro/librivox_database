{"books":{"10":{"id":"5447","title":"History of England, from the Accession of James II - (Volume 3, Chapter 16)","description":"This is volume 3 chapter 16 of a series of books written by the Baron Macaulay (1800-1859) in the 19th century. It starts with a brief resume of the history of England up until the Stuart kings and then starts to delve into a little more detail. Macaulay is primarily fascinated by ending of any claim to divine right of kings and the growing role of Parliament in the governing of the country. He sees the accession of William and Mary (Dutch, Protestant royalty) to the British throne as a key moment in the history of the British Isles. This is a book delightful for the literary gifts of the author and intriguing for his view of 18th century English and world politics.\n(Jim Mowatt)\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2612","language":"English","copyright_year":"1870","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5447","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/macaulay_vol3_chap16_1108_librivox\/macaulay_vol3_chap16_1108_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/history-of-england-from-the-accession-of-james-ii-volume-3-chapter-16-by-thomas-babington-macaulay\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:33:05","totaltimesecs":12785,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/macaulay_vol3_chap16_1108_librivox","sections":[{"id":"65300","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1200","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1472","display_name":"Sarah Jennings"}]},{"id":"65301","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1134","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6352","display_name":"stmacduff"}]},{"id":"65302","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1086","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6352","display_name":"stmacduff"}]},{"id":"65303","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 04","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1245","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6395","display_name":"Richard Carpenter"}]},{"id":"65304","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 05","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1406","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5002","display_name":"Brendan Stallard"}]},{"id":"65305","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1091","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6395","display_name":"Richard Carpenter"}]},{"id":"65306","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 07","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1122","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6395","display_name":"Richard Carpenter"}]},{"id":"65307","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1143","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6395","display_name":"Richard Carpenter"}]},{"id":"65308","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1105","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6352","display_name":"stmacduff"}]},{"id":"65309","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1272","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1065","display_name":"Justin Brett"}]},{"id":"65310","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XVI, Part 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"981","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
