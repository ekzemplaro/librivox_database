{"books":{"19":{"id":"5257","title":"Open Window","description":"LibriVox volunteers bring you 20 recordings of The Open Window by Edward Rowland Sill. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for February 27th, 2011.<br><br>Edward Rowland Sill, American poet and educator, was born in Windsor, Connecticut. He was a modest and charming man, a graceful essayist, a sure critic. His contribution to American poetry is small but of fine quality. His best poems, such as \"The Venus of Milo,\" \"The Fool's Prayer\" and \"Opportunity,\" gave him a high place among the minor poets of America, which might have been higher but for his early death.
