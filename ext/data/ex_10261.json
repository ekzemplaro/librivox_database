It was written in the form of brief articles submitted individually to the Pittsburgh Dispatch newspaper for publication. In it she described the conditions of the people and the political system she found in Mexico. Her narratives focused mostly on the impoverished and disadvantaged in a country whose government was extremely corrupt. In fact, her travels in Mexico ended abruptly as a result of an article she wrote which brought light on that government's treatment of a journalists who criticized the Porfirio Diaz regime. - Summary by James K.
