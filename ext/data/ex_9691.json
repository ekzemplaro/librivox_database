{"books":{"27":{"id":"9691","title":"Childhood","description":"Childhood is the first published novel by Leo Tolstoy, released under the initials L. N. in the November 1852 issue of the popular Russian literary journal The Contemporary.  It is the first in a series of three novels and is followed by Boyhood and Youth. Published when Tolstoy was just twenty-three years old, the book was an immediate success, earning notice from other Russian novelists including Ivan Turgenev, who heralded the young Tolstoy as a major up-and-coming figure in Russian literature.  Childhood is an exploration of the inner life of a young boy, Nikolenka, and one of the books in Russian writing to explore an expressionistic style, mixing fact, fiction and emotions to render the moods and reactions of the narrator. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2142","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"28","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9691","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/childhood_1503_librivox\/childhood_1503_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Childhood_(novel)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/childhood-by-leo-tolstoy\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:54:39","totaltimesecs":14079,"authors":[{"id":"217","first_name":"Leo","last_name":"Tolstoy","dob":"1828","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/childhood_1503_librivox","sections":[{"id":"334050","section_number":"1","title":"I.
