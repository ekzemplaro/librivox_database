{"books":{"6":{"id":"9589","title":"As a Man Thinketh (version 4)","description":"This book is about our thoughts and how they determine our actions and very being.  A few quotes will give a good taste of the riches in this book:\n\"A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.\"\n\"Cherish your visions. Cherish your ideals. Cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment, of these, if you but remain true to them your world will at last be built.\"\n\"The soul attracts that which it secretly harbors, that which it loves, and also that which it fears. It reaches the height of its cherished aspirations. It falls to the level of its unchastened desires \u2013 and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own.\"\n\"Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves, they therefore remain bound.\"\n\"Every action and feeling is preceded by a thought.\"\n\"Right thinking begins with the words we say to ourselves.\"\n\"Circumstance does not make the man, it reveals him to himself.\"\n\"You cannot travel within and stand still without.\"\n\"As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and patient training, so the man of weak thoughts, can make them strong by exercising himself in right thinking.\"\n\"Every man is where he is by the law of his being; the thoughts which he has built into his character have brought him there, and in the arrangement of his life there is no element of chance, but all is the result of a law which cannot err.\" - Summary by the author","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4507","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"7","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9589","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/asamanthinkethversion4_1502_librivox\/asamanthinkethversion4_1502_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/as-a-man-thinketh-version-4-by-james-allen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:00:26","totaltimesecs":3626,"authors":[{"id":"1323","first_name":"James","last_name":"Allen","dob":"1864","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/asamanthinkethversion4_1502_librivox","sections":[{"id":"330494","section_number":"1","title":"THOUGHT AND CHARACTER","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/asamanthinketh_01_allen.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"360","file_name":"asamanthinkethversion4_01_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330495","section_number":"2","title":"EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON CIRCUMSTANCES","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/asamanthinketh_02_allen.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1356","file_name":"asamanthinkethversion4_02_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330496","section_number":"3","title":"EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON HEALTH AND THE BODY","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/asamanthinketh_03_allen.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"304","file_name":"asamanthinkethversion4_03_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330497","section_number":"4","title":"THOUGHT AND PURPOSE","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/asamanthinketh_04_allen.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"312","file_name":"asamanthinkethversion4_04_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330498","section_number":"5","title":"THE THOUGHT-FACTOR IN ACHIEVEMENT","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/asamanthinketh_05_allen.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"448","file_name":"asamanthinkethversion4_05_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330499","section_number":"6","title":"VISIONS AND IDEALS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/asamanthinketh_06_allen.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"564","file_name":"asamanthinkethversion4_06_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330500","section_number":"7","title":"SERENITY","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/asamanthinketh_07_allen.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"282","file_name":"asamanthinkethversion4_07_allen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"}],"translators":[]}}}
