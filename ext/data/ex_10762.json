{"books":{"22":{"id":"10762","title":"Lonely Lady of Grosvenor Square","description":"Elizabeth de la Pasture, the author of this work, is the mother of the more well known E. M. Delafield- author of Diary Of A Provincial Lady.  Jeanne Marney, a country girl, comes to London to care for her ailing aunt. She is lonely and unhappy, yet unable to rebel against the many limitations put upon an upper class woman in turn-of-the-century London. Then she becomes an heiress... Would this be a blessing or a curse? This book has been made into a silent film in 1922. This book would be of interest to fans of Jane Austen, Francis Hodgson Burrnette, Henry James, and E. M. Delafield. - Summary by Stav Nisser.
