The first Sir Alan Frazer became a baronet owing to his services to King George during the \u201945 Rebellion. There was some trouble about a sequestered estate\u2014now our place in Scotland\u2014which belonged to his wife\u2019s brother, a Hume and a rebel. Anyhow, in 1763, he fought a duel with Hume\u2019s son, his own nephew by marriage, and was killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d broke in Brett, \u201cthis ancient history\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs quite to the point. Sir Alan the first fought and died in front of the library at Beechcroft.\u201d\n\nThe barrister commenced to study the moulding in the centre of the ceiling.\n\n\u201cHe was succeeded by his grandson, a little lad of eight. In 1807, after a heavy drinking bout, the second Sir Alan Hume-Frazer cut his throat, and chose the scene of his ancestor\u2019s duel for the operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA remarkable coincidence!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 1842, during a bread riot, the third baronet was stabbed with a pitchfork whilst facing a mob in the same place. Then a long interval occurred. Again a small child became the heir. Three years ago the fourth baronet expired whilst the library windows were being opened to admit the litter on which he was carried from the hunting-field. The fate of the fifth you know.\u201d - Summary by Chapter
