He made it a habit to never 'write down' to children and frequently used words beyond the average juvenile vocabulary, believing that youngsters respond to the stimulus of the unfamiliar.\"\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/21203","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"25","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2551","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/tale_of_grandfather_mole_lb_librivox\/tale_of_grandfather_mole_lb_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-tale-of-grandfather-mole-by-arthur-scott-bailey\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:02:08","totaltimesecs":7328,"authors":[{"id":"464","first_name":"Arthur
