{"books":{"32":{"id":"3272","title":"After London, or Wild England","description":" <br \/>Jefferies' novel can be seen as an early example of \"post-apocalyptic fiction.\" After some sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature, and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life.<br \/><br \/>The first part of the book, \"The Relapse into Barbarism\", is the account by some later historian of the fall of civilisation and its consequences, with a loving description of nature reclaiming England. The second part, \"Wild England\", is an adventure set many years later in the wild landscape and society.<br \/><br \/>The book is not without its flaws (notably the abrupt and unsatisfying ending) but is redeemed by the quality of the writing, particularly the unnervingly prophetic descriptions of the post-apocalyptic city and countryside.
