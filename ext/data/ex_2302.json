{"books":{"29":{"id":"2302","title":"Dark House","description":"An extremely wealthy but reclusive man has died, leaving an eccentric will which hints at great riches hidden somewhere in the house.  Most of the people at the reading of the will did not know the deceased in person, but had received kindnesses from him, for instance by the payment of school and university fees.  The principal beneficiary, a great-nephew, also did not know him.  The only two people who really knew him were the old lawyer who dealt with his affairs, and an old Indian servant.  Yet when the will had been read, and they all went to where the treasure--gold, jewels and bank-notes--were supposed to be hidden, nothing could be found.\n\nThere are an unusual number of deaths, by murder and in self-defence, as the story unfolds, and we are left in total suspense until the very end of the very last chapter.  The person who works out where the treasure must be, and how it got there, does not come on the scene until almost the last chapter, and even then he has to go on business to America\nbefore he can come in and explain his theory, which proves to be right.
