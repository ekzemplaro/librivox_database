{"books":{"9":{"id":"10985","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms","description":"Thomas Hardy, OM was an English novelist and poet. A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, especially William Wordsworth. Charles Dickens was another important influence. Like Dickens, he was highly critical of much in Victorian society, though Hardy focused more on a declining rural society. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/3167","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10985","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/middle_age_enthusiasms_1606.poem_librivox\/middle_age_enthusiasms_1606.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wessex_Poems_and_Other_Verses","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/middle-age-enthusiasms-by-thomas-hardy\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:15:33","totaltimesecs":933,"authors":[{"id":"92","first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Hardy","dob":"1840","dod":"1928"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/middle_age_enthusiasms_1606.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"373856","section_number":"1","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"95","file_name":"middleage_hardy_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"373853","section_number":"2","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"92","file_name":"middleage_hardy_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"373852","section_number":"3","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"103","file_name":"middleage_hardy_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"373858","section_number":"4","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":"middleage_hardy_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"373849","section_number":"5","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"91","file_name":"middleage_hardy_lah_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"373851","section_number":"6","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"101","file_name":"middleage_hardy_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"373857","section_number":"7","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":"middleage_hardy_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"373850","section_number":"8","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by MSD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_msd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"77","file_name":"middleage_hardy_msd_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10891","display_name":"Matthew Datcher"}]},{"id":"373854","section_number":"9","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by SABT","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_sabt_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":"middleage_hardy_sabt_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8932","display_name":"SkyAlbatross"}]},{"id":"373855","section_number":"10","title":"Middle Age Enthusiasms - Read by TP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/middleage_hardy_tp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"86","file_name":"middleage_hardy_tp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10789","display_name":"Tomas Peter"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
