This was the Weekly Poetry project for December 11, 2011.<br><br>Poor Robin's Almanac first appeared in England in the 17th century. It ran until sometime in the 18th century.<br>It was originally a satirical publication, although over the years it became less humorous and more of a source for traditional homilies.<br>Poor Robin is a pseudonym whose original user is unknown. William Winstanley and Robert Herrick are both possible candidates. More works were published under this pseudonym in America in the 1800s.(Summary by Lucy Perry)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/20586","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6169","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/thricewelcome_1112_librivox\/thricewelcome_1112_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poor_Robin","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/thrice-welcome-by-poor-robin\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:17:48","totaltimesecs":1068,"authors":[{"id":"5873","first_name":" Harrison S.","last_name":"Morris","dob":"1856","dod":"1948"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/thricewelcome_1112_librivox","sections":[{"id":"84220","section_number":"1","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by AJ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"62","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5468","display_name":"ashleighjane"}]},{"id":"84221","section_number":"2","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by CC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"53","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4586","display_name":"Chris Caron"}]},{"id":"84222","section_number":"3","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"64","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"84223","section_number":"4","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by Elli","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3885","display_name":"Elli"}]},{"id":"84224","section_number":"5","title":"Thrice Welcome - Sung by EZWA","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"60","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"84225","section_number":"6","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by FS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6735","display_name":"fshort"}]},{"id":"84226","section_number":"7","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by GC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"59","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6733","display_name":"Snapdragon"}]},{"id":"84227","section_number":"8","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by GHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"66","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"84228","section_number":"9","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by HR","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5764","display_name":"Herman Roskams"}]},{"id":"84229","section_number":"10","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by JCM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"62","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3470","display_name":"Jason Mills"}]},{"id":"84230","section_number":"11","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by LAH","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"62","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"84231","section_number":"12","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by LKP","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"56","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3615","display_name":"Lucy Perry"}]},{"id":"84232","section_number":"13","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by LLB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6707","display_name":"Lewis"}]},{"id":"84233","section_number":"14","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by LLW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"84234","section_number":"15","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by NLB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"73","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6965","display_name":"NoelBadrian"}]},{"id":"84235","section_number":"16","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by RN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"75","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3465","display_name":"ravenotation"}]},{"id":"84236","section_number":"17","title":"Thrice Welcome - Read by RO","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"56","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6924","display_name":"Rapunzelina"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"88","name":"House & Home"},{"id":"96","name":"Nature"}],"translators":[]}}}
