{"books":{"10":{"id":"5879","title":"Divine Cordial (All Things for Good)","description":"This book is an exposition of Romans 8:28: \"We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\" It was written in 1663, one year after Thomas Watson and many other Puritan ministers were forced out of their pulpits by the Act of Uniformity. Watson's book radiates comfort in the midst of suffering. Its content is equally applicable to Christians facing trials today.
