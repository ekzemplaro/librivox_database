{"books":{"19":{"id":"2643","title":"Great Pirate Stories","description":"<p>\nPiracy embodies the romance of the sea at its highest expression. It is\na sad but inevitable commentary on our civilization, that, so far as the\nsea is concerned, it has developed from its infancy down to a century or\nso ago, under one phase or another of piracy. If men were savages on\nland they were doubly so at sea, and all the years of maritime\nadventure--years that added to the map of the world till there was\nlittle left to discover--could not wholly eradicate the piratical germ.\nIt went out gradually with the settlement and ordering of the far-flung\nBritish colonies. Great Britain, foremost of sea powers, must be\ncredited with doing more both directly and indirectly for the abolition\nof crime and disorder on the high seas than any other force. But the\nconquest was not complete till the advent of steam which chased the\nsea-rover into the farthest corners of his domain. It is said that he\nsurvives even today in certain spots in the Chinese waters,--but he is\ncertainly an innocuous relic. A pirate of any sort would be as great a\ncuriosity today if he could be caught and exhibited as a fabulous\nmonster.\n(Summary from text)\n<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/27090","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2643","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/great_pirate_stories_0905_librivox.org\/great_pirate_stories_0905_librivox.org_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/great-pirate-stories-by-joseph-lewis-french\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:46:48","totaltimesecs":31608,"authors":[{"id":"4966","first_name":" Joseph Lewis","last_name":"French","dob":"1858","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/great_pirate_stories_0905_librivox.org","sections":[{"id":"169637","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
