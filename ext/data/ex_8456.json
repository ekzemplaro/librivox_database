{"books":{"17":{"id":"8456","title":"Ministry of Intercession","description":"Andrew Murray sub-titled this book \"A Plea for More Prayer\". In it, he shows how throughout Scripture, in the life of every saint, and that of God\u2019s own Son, and all through Church history, God is, first of all, a prayer-hearing God. He builds upon the truths brought out in his earlier volume \u201cWith Christ in the School of Prayer\u201d, by showing firstly that Christ meant prayer to be the great power by which His Church should do its work, and secondly that we have far too little conception of the place that intercession, as opposed to praying just for our own needs, should have in the Church and in the Christian life. The book concludes with some very helpful practical guidelines on intercession. - Summary by Christopher Smith","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ministryofinterc00murruoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1898","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8456","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox\/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-ministry-of-intercession-by-andrew-murray\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"06:01:32","totaltimesecs":21692,"authors":[{"id":"2839","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Murray","dob":"1828","dod":"1917"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox","sections":[{"id":"300476","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/ministryofintercession_00_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1193","file_name":"ministryofintercession_00_murray_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"300477","section_number":"1","title":"The Lack of Prayer","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/ministryofintercession_01_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"905","file_name":"ministryofintercession_01_murray_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"300478","section_number":"2","title":"The Ministration of the Spirit and Prayer","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/ministryofintercession_02_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"898","file_name":"ministryofintercession_02_murray_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"300479","section_number":"3","title":"A Model of Intercession","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/ministryofintercession_03_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"979","file_name":"ministryofintercession_03_murray_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"300480","section_number":"4","title":"Because of his Importunity","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/ministryofintercession_04_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1035","file_name":"ministryofintercession_04_murray_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"300481","section_number":"5","title":"The Life that can Pray","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/ministryofintercession_05_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1023","file_name":"ministryofintercession_05_murray_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"300482","section_number":"6","title":"Restraining Prayer -
