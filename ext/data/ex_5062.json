{"books":{"9":{"id":"5062","title":"Public Domain Hymns 01","description":"\"Originally modeled on the Psalms and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as \"canticles\") in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise and worship to the monotheistic God. Many refer to Jesus Christ either directly or indirectly. Since the earliest times, Christians have sung \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\", both in private devotions and in corporate worship (Matthew 26:30; 1 Cor 14:26; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; James 5:13; cf. Revelation 5:8-10; Revelation 14:1-5). One definition of a hymn is \"...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it.\" <br\/>(Summary by Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.simusic.com\/worship\/hymns\/","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5062","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/publicdomainhymns_01_1110_librivox\/publicdomainhymns_01_1110_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/public-domain-hymns-01-by-various\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:41:36","totaltimesecs":9696,"authors":[{"id":"18","first_name":"","last_name":"Various","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/publicdomainhymns_01_1110_librivox","sections":[{"id":"54580","section_number":"1","title":"Section 01, Subsection 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1388","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"54581","section_number":"2","title":"Section 01, Subsection 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"971","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5940","display_name":"Gargoyle"}]},{"id":"54582","section_number":"3","title":"Section 01, Subsection 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"827","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5940","display_name":"Gargoyle"}]},{"id":"54583","section_number":"4","title":"Section 01, Subsection 04","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"540","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4586","display_name":"Chris Caron"}]},{"id":"54584","section_number":"5","title":"Section 01, Subsection 05","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"678","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6079","display_name":"Jubela"}]},{"id":"54585","section_number":"6","title":"Section 01, Subsection 06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"842","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2392","display_name":"afloatinglife"}]},{"id":"54586","section_number":"7","title":"Section 01, Subsection 07","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1497","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"54587","section_number":"8","title":"Section 01, Subsection 08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"917","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"54588","section_number":"9","title":"Section 01, Subsection 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"990","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4745","display_name":"Colman Shew"}]},{"id":"54589","section_number":"10","title":"Section 01, Subsection 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1046","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5949","display_name":"debolee"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"95","name":"Music"},{"id":"130","name":"Christianity - Other"}],"translators":[]}}}
