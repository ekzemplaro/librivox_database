{"books":{"11":{"id":"1991","title":"All Things Considered","description":"Another delightful and sharply pointed excursion into the topics of the day, and of this day as well, with Gilbert Keith Chesterton. These reprinted magazine articles are filled with his good natured wit, his masterful use of paradox, and devastating ability to use reductio ad absurdum to destroy the popular myths that drive a society driving full-speed into secular humanism. You will come away with a whole new collection of wonderful quotes. \n- Ray Clare \n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/11505","language":"English","copyright_year":"1908","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1991","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/all_things_considered_rc_librivox\/all_things_considered_rc_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/all-things-considered-by-g-k-chesterton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:39:00","totaltimesecs":23940,"authors":[{"id":"426","first_name":"G.
