{"books":{"9":{"id":"8530","title":"Puck of Pook's Hill (version 2)","description":"'Puck of Pook's Hill' is a fantasy book by Rudyard Kipling, published in 1906, containing a series of short stories set in different periods of English history. It can count both as historical fantasy \u2013 since some of the stories told of the past have clear magical elements, and as contemporary fantasy \u2013 since it depicts a magical being active and practising his magic in the England of the early 1900s when the book was written.<br \/><br \/>The stories are all narrated to two children living near Burwash, in the area of Kipling's own house Bateman's, by people magically plucked out of history by the elf Puck, or told by Puck himself. (Puck, who refers to himself as \"the oldest Old Thing in England\", is better known as a character in William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream.) The genres of particular stories range from authentic historical novella (A Centurion of the Thirtieth, On the Great Wall) to children's fantasy (Dymchurch Flit). Each story is bracketed by a poem which relates in some manner to the theme or subject of the story. - Summary by Wikipedia<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/15976","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8530","url_zip_file":"https:\/\/archive.org\/download\/puck_pooks_hill_1404_librivox\/puck_pooks_hill_1404_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puck_of_Pook's_Hill","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/puck-of-pooks-hill-version-2-by-rudyard-kipling\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:11:41","totaltimesecs":25901,"authors":[{"id":"144","first_name":"Rudyard","last_name":"Kipling","dob":"1868","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/puck_pooks_hill_1404_librivox","sections":[{"id":"301966","section_number":"1","title":"Weland's Sword","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_01_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2693","file_name":"puckofpookshill_01_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301967","section_number":"2","title":"Young Men at the Manor","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_02_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2519","file_name":"puckofpookshill_02_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301968","section_number":"3","title":"The Knights of the Joyous Venture","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_03_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3237","file_name":"puckofpookshill_03_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301969","section_number":"4","title":"Old Men at Pevensey","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_04_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3066","file_name":"puckofpookshill_04_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301970","section_number":"5","title":"A Centurion of the Thirtieth","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_05_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2188","file_name":"puckofpookshill_05_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301971","section_number":"6","title":"On the Great Wall","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_06_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2605","file_name":"puckofpookshill_06_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301972","section_number":"7","title":"The Winged Hats","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_07_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2672","file_name":"puckofpookshill_07_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301973","section_number":"8","title":"Hal o' the Draft","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_08_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2318","file_name":"puckofpookshill_08_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301974","section_number":"9","title":"'Dymchurch Flit'","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_09_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2159","file_name":"puckofpookshill_09_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]},{"id":"301975","section_number":"10","title":"The Treasure and the Law","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/puckofpookshill_10_kipling_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2444","file_name":"puckofpookshill_10_kipling_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8143","display_name":"Nick Whitley"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"39","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
