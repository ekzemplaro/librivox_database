In large measure we travel the same highways, read the same books, speak the same language, yet our experiences are different. All my comings and goings turn on the hand as on a pivot. It is the hand that binds me to the world of men and women. The hand is my feeler with which I reach through isolation and darkness and seize every pleasure, every activity that my fingers encounter. With the dropping of a little word from another's hand into mine, a slight flutter of the fingers, began the intelligence, the joy, the fullness of my life.<\/i> Helen Keller, quoted from her essay, <i>The Seeing Hand<\/i> (Summary from text and Laura Caldwell)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/27683","language":"English","copyright_year":"1908","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3084","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/world_i_live_in_0905_librivox\/world_i_live_in_0905_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-world-i-live-in-by-helen-keller\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:49:10","totaltimesecs":10150,"authors":[{"id":"438","first_name":"Helen","last_name":"Keller","dob":"1888","dod":"1968"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/world_i_live_in_0905_librivox","sections":[{"id":"179182","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"145","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179183","section_number":"1","title":"The Seeing Hand","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"723","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179184","section_number":"2","title":"The Hands of Others","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"586","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179185","section_number":"3","title":"The Hand of the Race","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"531","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179186","section_number":"4","title":"The Power of Touch","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"755","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179187","section_number":"5","title":"The Finer Vibrations","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"619","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179188","section_number":"6","title":"Smell, the Fallen Angel","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"708","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179189","section_number":"7","title":"Relative Values of the Senses","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"320","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179190","section_number":"8","title":"The Five-Sensed World","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"449","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179191","section_number":"9","title":"Inward Visions","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"548","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179192","section_number":"10","title":"Analogies in Sense Perception","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"490","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179193","section_number":"11","title":"Before the Soul Dawn","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"467","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179194","section_number":"12","title":"The Larger Sanctions","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"637","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179195","section_number":"13","title":"The Dream World","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1157","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179196","section_number":"14","title":"Dreams and Reality","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"518","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179197","section_number":"15","title":"A Walking Dream","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"879","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"179198","section_number":"16","title":"A Chant of Darkness","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"618","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
