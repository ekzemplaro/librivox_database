{"books":{"11":{"id":"1248","title":"Big Bow Mystery","description":"<p>It's a cold and foggy night in London. A man is horribly murdered in his bedroom, the door locked and bolted on the inside. Scotland Yard is stumped. Yet the seemingly unsolvable case has, as Inspector Grodman says, \"one sublimely simple solution\" that is revealed in a final chapter full of revelations and a shocking denouement. Detective fiction afficionados will be happy to learn that all the evidence to solve the case is provided. One of the earliest \u201clocked room\u201d mystery stories, The Big Bow Mystery is also a satire of late Victorian society.
