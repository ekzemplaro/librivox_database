{"books":{"25":{"id":"5763","title":"Life in the Grey Nunnery at Montreal","description":"Life in the Grey Nunnery was first published in Boston, in 1857 by Edward P. Hood, who was credited as the book's editor. It is likely that this account is by Sarah J. Richardson \"as told to\" Edward Hood, though it may in fact be completely fictional. It is clearly an anti-Catholic book, an example of the genre of fiction referred to as \"the convent horror story.\" <br \/><br \/>As this summary shows, it is not known if this book is fictional or a true account.(Summary by project Gutenberg and Elaine Webb)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5734","language":"English","copyright_year":"1857","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5763","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/grey_nunnery_1110_librivox\/grey_nunnery_1110_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/life-in-the-grey-nunnery-at-montreal-by-sarah-j-richardson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:58:47","totaltimesecs":25127,"authors":[{"id":"5797","first_name":"
