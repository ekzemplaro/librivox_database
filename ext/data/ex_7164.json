{"books":{"22":{"id":"7164","title":"From a Swedish Homestead","description":"\u201dFrom a Swedish Homestead\u201d by the Swedish author Selma Lagerloef (translated by Jessie Brochner) is a varied collection of stories, mostly set in Dalarne or Vaermland in Sweden, but also some stories or legends from Kungahalla on the west-coast at the time between Heathendom and early Christianity plus some Legends from Italy and Belgium. The first nine sections, \u201cThe Story of a Country House\u201d, is a short Novel, originally published on its own, but here part of the collection.\nIt is the story of how a young orphan girl, Ingrid, is the instrument of saving the student Gunnar Hede, who has lost his wits and memory by a terrible experience, trying to save his home, his Couyntry House, and who wanders the roads as a Pedlar, but at the same time afraid of most everything, especially animals. As told by Lagerloef it is a both fascinating and sweet story, as are all the others.
