{"books":{"54":{"id":"10213","title":"Dead Men's Shoes","description":"Sybil, a gentlewoman who has to work for a living, finally finds employment as her rich uncle's house keeper. Nothing could be better: she would finally have an easy job in which she is treated well, and inherit her uncle's money after his death. But then she falls in love with the wrong man. When her uncle is poisoned, suspicion falls upon her. How would she be able to clear her name? What really happened to her uncle? This is a first rate murder mystery, for fans of Wilkie Collins. Yet it is also a story about love: family love, romantic love, and the love we bear for our community. - Summary by Stav Nisser.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/deadmensshoesnov00brad","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"55","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10213","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"nun.","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"9757","first_name":"Mary
