{"books":{"11":{"id":"1916","title":"Mysterious Stranger and Other Stories","description":"<p>Here's a Mark Twain story that's very unlike those he became famous for, but when I read it back in Catholic high school, it left a deep impression.  It concerns the deeply religious residents of a small village in Austria during the late sixteenth century, and what happened to several of them when a strange man began to visit their insulated homeland.  There's little of Twain's humor here; this is a horror story, a parable. . . and a warning. <br>(Summary by Ted Delorme)<\/br><\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/3186","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1916","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/mysterious_stranger_td_librivox\/mysterious_stranger_td_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Mysterious_Stranger","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-mysterious-stranger-and-other-stories-by-mark-twain\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:33:12","totaltimesecs":16392,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/mysterious_stranger_td_librivox","sections":[{"id":"154768","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"563","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154769","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1130","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154770","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1305","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154771","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"367","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154772","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1615","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154773","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1623","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154774","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2414","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154775","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2649","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154776","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"722","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154777","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1700","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154778","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"446","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]},{"id":"154779","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1858","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"543","display_name":"Ted Delorme"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"16","name":"Horror & Supernatural Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
