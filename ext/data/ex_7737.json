{"books":{"10":{"id":"7737","title":"Mari, Our Little Norwegian Cousin","description":"\"Long before Columbus discovered America, there were brave men in the north of Europe who dared to sail farther out upon the unknown waters of the Atlantic than any other people in the world. These daring seamen were called Vikings. Their home was the peninsula of Scandinavia, now ruled over by one king, although divided into two distinct countries, Norway and Sweden. <br><br>\n\nMany of our Norwegian cousins have come to America to make a new home for themselves where the sun shines more warmly and the winds blow less keenly. Their fair-haired children are growing up amongst us, showing us the qualities their parents most admire. Be brave, be honest, be kind to all creatures, be faithful to every little duty,\u2014these are the lessons they have been taught from babyhood, as well as their brothers and sisters who have not as yet ventured far from the land they love so well,\u2014the land of rapid-flowing rivers, deep, dark bays, and narrow valleys.... Come with me to-day to the home of one of these blue-eyed cousins and join her for a while in her work and play.\"(Summary by preface of the author)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/42079","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7737","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ourlittlenorwegiancousin_1306_librivox\/ourlittlenorwegiancousin_1306_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/mari-our-little-norwegian-cousin-by-mary-hazelton-blanchard-wade\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:39:41","totaltimesecs":5981,"authors":[{"id":"9754","first_name":"Mary Hazelton Blanchard","last_name":"Wade","dob":"1860","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ourlittlenorwegiancousin_1306_librivox","sections":[{"id":"118868","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"149","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2825","display_name":"Ernst Pattynama"}]},{"id":"118869","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The Farm","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"734","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8199","display_name":"maryagneskatherine"}]},{"id":"118870","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Visitors","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"799","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6548","display_name":"Kristin Gjerl\u00f8w"}]},{"id":"118871","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Christening","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"516","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6548","display_name":"Kristin Gjerl\u00f8w"}]},{"id":"118872","section_number":"4","title":"04 - The Lost Pin","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"722","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6548","display_name":"Kristin Gjerl\u00f8w"}]},{"id":"118873","section_number":"5","title":"05 - The Birthday","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"341","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7510","display_name":"Kathrine Engan"}]},{"id":"118874","section_number":"6","title":"06 - The Wedding","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"326","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7850","display_name":"Jill Engle"}]},{"id":"118875","section_number":"7","title":"07 - \tLegends","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1082","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7850","display_name":"Jill Engle"}]},{"id":"118876","section_number":"8","title":"08 - The Lumber Camp","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"490","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"118877","section_number":"9","title":"09 - The Lapps","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"492","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7510","display_name":"Kathrine Engan"}]},{"id":"118878","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Holiday Frolics","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"330","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"41","name":"General"}],"translators":[]}}}
