{"books":{"19":{"id":"4794","title":"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (version 2)","description":"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), published in 1889, is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford. <br\/>The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers \u2014 the jokes seem fresh and witty even today. \n(Wikipedia)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/308","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4794","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/three_men_in_a_boat_v2_1103_librivox\/three_men_in_a_boat_v2_1103_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Three_Men_in_a_Boat","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/three-men-in-a-boat-version-2-by-jerome-k-jerome\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:24:16","totaltimesecs":23056,"authors":[{"id":"529","first_name":"Jerome K.","last_name":"Jerome","dob":"1859","dod":"1927"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/three_men_in_a_boat_v2_1103_librivox","sections":[{"id":"48026","section_number":"0","title":"Preface to American Edition","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"90","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"48027","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1314","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"48028","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"765","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6087","display_name":"Caroline Driggs"}]},{"id":"48029","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1156","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5077","display_name":"Sandra G"}]},{"id":"48030","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1619","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5077","display_name":"Sandra G"}]},{"id":"48031","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"997","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5694","display_name":"Winston Tharp"}]},{"id":"48032","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1492","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6119","display_name":"Vinnie Tesla"}]},{"id":"48033","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1150","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6120","display_name":"Terra Mendoza"}]},{"id":"48034","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1444","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6120","display_name":"Terra Mendoza"}]},{"id":"48035","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1226","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6087","display_name":"Caroline Driggs"}]},{"id":"48036","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1305","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6120","display_name":"Terra Mendoza"}]},{"id":"48037","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1262","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5694","display_name":"Winston Tharp"}]},{"id":"48038","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1424","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6087","display_name":"Caroline Driggs"}]},{"id":"48039","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1439","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5628","display_name":"Adrian Wheal"}]},{"id":"48040","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 14","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1321","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5628","display_name":"Adrian Wheal"}]},{"id":"48041","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter 15","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1665","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5628","display_name":"Adrian Wheal"}]},{"id":"48042","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter 16","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"433","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5628","display_name":"Adrian Wheal"}]},{"id":"48043","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter 17","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"918","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5628","display_name":"Adrian Wheal"}]},{"id":"48044","section_number":"18","title":"Chapter 18","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"844","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5628","display_name":"Adrian Wheal"}]},{"id":"48045","section_number":"19","title":"Chapter 19","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1192","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5628","display_name":"Adrian Wheal"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
