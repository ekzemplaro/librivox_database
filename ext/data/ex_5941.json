His first book was published in 1904. In 1906 he co-founded the Hebrew-language publishing house Nisyonot (Attempts), and after moving to London in 1907, he co-edited (with Hayim Yosef Brenner) <i>Ha'Meorer<\/i>, a Hebrew periodical. Later he emigrated to Palestine but returned to Russia, then moved to Warsaw, where he died in 1913 of a heart attack. Gnessin wrote in a unique style of prose notable for its expressionistic language form. The story \"Etsel\" is about a young man suffering severe heart disease, unable to love or accept the love of several women around him.
