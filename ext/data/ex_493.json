{"books":{"13":{"id":"493","title":"History of England, from the Accession of James II - (Volume 1, Chapter 01)","description":"<p>This is chapter 1 of volume 1 of a series of books written by the Baron Macaulay in the 19th century. It starts with a brief resume of the history of England up until the Stuart kings and then starts to delve into a little more detail. Macaulay is primarily fascinated by ending of any claim to divine right of kings and the growing role of Parliament in the governing of the country. He sees the accession of William and Mary (Dutch, Protestant royalty) to the British throne as a key moment in the history of the British Isles. This is a book delightful for the literary gifts of the author and intriguing for his view of 18th century English and world politics.\n(Summary by Jim Mowatt)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1468","language":"English","copyright_year":"1848","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/493","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/history_of_england_v1_ch1_librivox\/history_of_england_v1_ch1_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/history-of-england-volume-1-chapter-1\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:41:56","totaltimesecs":20516,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/history_of_england_v1_ch1_librivox","sections":[{"id":"127984","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1598","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"127985","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter I, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1656","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"127986","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter I, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1086","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"127987","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter I, Part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"961","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"127988","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter I, Part 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1445","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"127989","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter I, Part 6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1786","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"127990","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter I, Part 7","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1100","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"127991","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter I, Part 8","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1724","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"127992","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter I, Part 9","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1001","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"313","display_name":"Dilini Jayasinghe"}]},{"id":"127993","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter I, Part 10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2199","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"127994","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter I, Part 11","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1129","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"127995","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter I, Part 12","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1700","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"127996","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter I, Part 13","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1712","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"46","display_name":"Aaron Hochwimmer"}]},{"id":"127997","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter I, Part 14","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1419","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"313","display_name":"Dilini Jayasinghe"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
