{"books":{"52":{"id":"707","title":"Edison, His Life and Inventions","description":"<p>A detailed biography of Thomas Alva Edison, inventor of such things as the telephone, the microphone, the electric motor, the storage battery, and the electric light. In the words of the authors, \"It is designed in these pages to bring the reader face to face with Edison; to glance at an interesting childhood and a youthful period marked by a capacity for doing things, and by an insatiable thirst for knowledge; then to accompany him into the great creative stretch of forty years, during which he has done so much. This book shows him plunged deeply into work for which he has always had an incredible capacity, reveals the exercise of his unsurpassed inventive ability, his keen reasoning powers, his tenacious memory, his fertility of resource; follows him through a series of innumerable experiments, conducted methodically, reaching out like rays of search-light into all the regions of science and nature, and finally exhibits him emerging triumphantly from countless difficulties bearing with him in new arts the fruits of victorious struggle.\" (written by Justin Barrett, with authors' quote taken from the work itself)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/820","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"53","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/707","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/edison_his_life_0809_librivox\/edison_his_life_0809_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/edison-his-life-by-dyer-and-martin\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"29:41:34","totaltimesecs":106894,"authors":[{"id":"4284","first_name":" Frank Lewis","last_name":"Dyer","dob":"1870","dod":"1941"},{"id":"6223","first_name":" Thomas Commerford","last_name":"Martin","dob":"1856","dod":"1924"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/edison_his_life_0809_librivox","sections":[{"id":"131703","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"338","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"770","display_name":"Justin S Barrett"}]},{"id":"131704","section_number":"1","title":"The Age Of Electricity","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"822","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"770","display_name":"Justin S Barrett"}]},{"id":"131705","section_number":"2","title":"Edison's Pedigree","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1303","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"770","display_name":"Justin S Barrett"}]},{"id":"131706","section_number":"3","title":"Boyhood At Port Huron, Michigan","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2752","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2481","display_name":"Alana Jordan"}]},{"id":"131707","section_number":"4","title":"The Young Telegraph Operator","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1802","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2673","display_name":"jude kaider"}]},{"id":"131708","section_number":"5","title":"Arduous Years In The Central West","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3108","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"949","display_name":"ontheroad"}]},{"id":"131709","section_number":"6","title":"Work And Invention In Boston","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1470","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"949","display_name":"ontheroad"}]},{"id":"131710","section_number":"7","title":"The Stock Ticker","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2649","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2246","display_name":"RaySee"}]},{"id":"131711","section_number":"8","title":"Automatic, Duplex, And Quadruplex Telegraphy","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3444","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2074","display_name":"Tysto"}]},{"id":"131712","section_number":"9","title":"The Telephone, Motograph, And Microphone","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"4075","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2254","display_name":"Heidi Preuss"}]},{"id":"131713","section_number":"10","title":"The Phonograph","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2832","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"688","display_name":"J.
