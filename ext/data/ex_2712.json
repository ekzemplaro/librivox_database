{"books":{"9":{"id":"2712","title":"Selected Short Stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald","description":"<p>Ranging in tone from humor to sentimentality, these stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald are set against a backdrop of jazz, flappers, and the changing mores of American society.  In \"Bernice Bobs Her Hair,\" wallflower Bernice is taken in hand by her more popular cousin, whose motives are not entirely altruistic.  In \"Benediction,\" a young woman visits her brother in seminary.  A camel goes to a party in \"The Camel's Back.\"  \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" is a poignant fantasy about a man who ages backward.  Finally, tragedy befalls a young couple in \"The Lees of Happiness.\"  The stories in this collection are from the books <i>Flappers and Philosophers<\/i> and <i>Tales of the Jazz Age<\/i>.
