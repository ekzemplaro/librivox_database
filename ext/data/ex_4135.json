{"books":{"23":{"id":"4135","title":"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (version 2)","description":"<br \/>A collection of twelve short stories featuring Conan Doyle's legendary detective, originally published as single stories in <i>Strand Magazine<\/i> and subsequently collected into a single volume.<br \/><br \/>There is not always a crime committed nor a culprit to find, and when there is, Holmes does not invariably get his man. However, his extraordinary powers of deduction generally solve the mystery, often to the discomfiture of the official police force. Holmes is a man of many facets, and I do not share the common perception of Holmes as cold and humourless: his sense of fun can be sparkling, and there are moments of rare pathos.
