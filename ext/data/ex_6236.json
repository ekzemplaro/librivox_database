This was the Weekly Poetry project for January 8, 2012.<br><br>Here is a poem by the \"fleshly\" poet, Bunthorne, from the opera Patience, by Gilbert and Sullivan. Who better to introduce it than the poet himself:<br><br>BUNTHORNE. It is a wild, weird, fleshy thing; yet very tender, very\nyearning, very precious. It is called, \"Oh, Hollow! Hollow! \nHollow!\"<br>PATIENCE Is it a hunting song?<br>BUNTHORNE. A hunting song? No, it is not a hunting song. It is the\nwail of the poet's heart on discovering that everything is\ncommonplace. To understand it, cling passionately to one another\nand think of faint lilies.<br><br>Bunthorne was considered to have been modelled on Oscar Wilde, but more recent reseach has suggested that this claim is not correct.
