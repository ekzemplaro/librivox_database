{"books":{"16":{"id":"2187","title":"Faces and Places","description":"<br \/><em>Faces and Places<\/em> is a collection of articles on nineteenth century travel, events and personalities by the British journalist Henry Lucy, who wrote for the Daily News, a London newspaper. His open letter <em>To Those About to Become Journalists<\/em> rings as true today as when it was written.<br \/><br \/>The first article, <em>\"Fred\" Burnaby<\/em>, includes a lively account of a balloon trip, while <em>Night and Day on the Cars in Canada<\/em> and <em>Easter on Les Avants<\/em> relate Lucy's experiences of rail travel at that time. Other travel tales (<em>A Night on a Mountain<\/em>, <em>Mosquitoes and Monaco<\/em>, and <em>Oysters and Arcachon<\/em>) provide an insight into the Victorian Englishman's attitude to Europe.<br \/><br \/>Three of the pieces, <em>With Peggotty and Ham<\/em>, <em>A Cinque Port<\/em> and <em>Christmas Eve at Watts's<\/em>, concern the county of Kent, where Lucy had a country house. <em>Christmas Eve at Watts's<\/em> contains an interesting expos\u00e9 of Dickens' short story <em>The Seven Poor Travellers<\/em>.<br \/><br \/>Other articles are of historical interest: <em>A Wreck in the North Sea<\/em> is an account of the wreck of the ship \"Deutschland\" in 1875; <em>A Historic Crowd<\/em> describes the massive popular interest in the 1871 trial of the Tichborne Claimant; <em>The Battle of Merthyr<\/em> contains an eye-witness account of the Merthyr Riots of 1831; <em>The Prince of Wales<\/em> paints a portrait of the future King Edward VII.<br \/><br \/>Lucy, who also wrote as \"Toby, M.P.\" for the satirical magazine Punch, loved to poke gentle fun, particularly at the establishment, and this is especially evident in <em>A Peep at an Old House of Commons<\/em> and <em>Some Preachers I Have Known<\/em>.<br \/><br \/>This eclectic collection, mostly affectionately humorous, but with moments of great pathos, was originally published in 1892 in The Whitefriars Library of Wit & Humour.(Summary by Ruth Golding)<br \/><br \/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/5\/6\/2\/25624","language":"English","copyright_year":"1892","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2187","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/faces_places_rg_librivox\/faces_places_rg_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/faces-and-places-by-henry-w-lucy\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:59:11","totaltimesecs":25151,"authors":[{"id":"1092","first_name":"Sir Henry W.","last_name":"Lucy","dob":"1842","dod":"1924"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/faces_places_rg_librivox","sections":[{"id":"159872","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I  -
