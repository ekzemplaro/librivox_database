{"books":{"11":{"id":"10507","title":"Dirge for the Year","description":"Percy Bysshe Shelley was one of the major English Romantic poets, and is regarded by some as among the finest lyric, as well as epic, poets in the English language. A radical in his poetry as well as in his political and social views, Shelley did not see fame during his lifetime, but recognition for his poetry grew steadily following his death. Shelley was a key member of a close circle of visionary poets and writers that included Lord Byron; Leigh Hunt; Thomas Love Peacock; and his own second wife, Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4800","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10507","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/dirge_for_the_year_1601.poem_librivox\/dirge_for_the_year_1601.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/dirge-for-the-year-by-percy-bysshe-shelley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:18:37","totaltimesecs":1117,"authors":[{"id":"216","first_name":"Percy Bysshe","last_name":"Shelley","dob":"1792","dod":"1822"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/dirge_for_the_year_1601.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"359004","section_number":"1","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"107","file_name":"dirge_shelley_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"359012","section_number":"2","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by BSD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_bsd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"92","file_name":"dirge_shelley_bsd_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10402","display_name":"Brian Darby"}]},{"id":"359006","section_number":"3","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"86","file_name":"dirge_shelley_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"359002","section_number":"4","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"89","file_name":"dirge_shelley_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"359008","section_number":"5","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by F","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_f_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"92","file_name":"dirge_shelley_f_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10362","display_name":"Fabiola"}]},{"id":"359003","section_number":"6","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"107","file_name":"dirge_shelley_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"359011","section_number":"7","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":"dirge_shelley_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"359010","section_number":"8","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by JDB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_jdb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"91","file_name":"dirge_shelley_jdb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"359005","section_number":"9","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by JEF","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_jef_128kp.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"84","file_name":"dirge_shelley_jef_128kp.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10494","display_name":"Jennifer Fournier"}]},{"id":"359009","section_number":"10","title":"Dirge for the Year - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/dirge_shelley_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"84","file_name":"dirge_shelley_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
