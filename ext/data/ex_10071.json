{"books":{"36":{"id":"10071","title":"Wonders of the Invisible World, and A Farther Account of the Tryals of the New England Witches","description":"Here's an eye witness account of the trials of several witches executed in New England, including the famous \"Salem Witch Trials\".  The text spells out ways to identify witches, and gives us a serious look into the frenzy of terror whipped up against those who either could not or would not conform to the Puritanical views of the period. The sub-title of the book reads (parenthesis are mine): BEING AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRYALS OF SEVERAL WITCHES LATELY EXECUTED IN NEW-ENGLAND. BY COTTON MATHER, D.D., TO WHICH IS ADDED A FARTHER ACCOUNT OF THE TRYALS OF THE NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES. BY (his father), INCREASE MATHER, D.D.
