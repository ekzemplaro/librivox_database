A crime has been committed by an unknown assassin, within a short distance of the principal streets of this great city, and is surrounded by an inpenetrable mystery. \u2026 \r\n\r\n\u201cOn the twenty-seventh day of July, at the hour of twenty minutes to two o'clock in the morning, a hansom cab drove up to the police station in Grey Street, St. Kilda, and the driver made the startling statement that his cab contained the body of a man who he had reason to believe had been murdered\u2026.\u201d (Excerpt from the first chapter.)<\/p>\r\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4223","language":"English","copyright_year":"1886","num_sections":"36","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2424","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/hansom_cab_sd_0808_librivox\/hansom_cab_sd_0808_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-mystery-of-a-hansom-cab-by-fergus-hume\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:41:50","totaltimesecs":27710,"authors":[{"id":"2667","first_name":"Fergus","last_name":"Hume","dob":"1859","dod":"1932"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/hansom_cab_sd_0808_librivox","sections":[{"id":"164417","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
