{"books":{"23":{"id":"10691","title":"Welsh Fairy Tales","description":"This is a collection of delightful tales that explore the uniqueness of the Welsh people, Welsh heroes, Welsh countryside, Welsh animals and Welsh pride.   Some other minor peoples are mentioned in passing (the English, The Scots, etc.) but mainly these stories embody the exuberant pride and joy in living of the Welsh people as well as their wry humor.   Most stories are fairly short and would make a wonderful recording evening for our LibriVox readers.   - Summary by Phil
