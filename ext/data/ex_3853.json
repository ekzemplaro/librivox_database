{"books":{"15":{"id":"3853","title":"Hero and Leander","description":"\u201cWho ever lov\u2019d, that lov\u2019d not at first sight?\u201d<br\/><br\/>\nThe wonder-decade of the English drama was suddenly interrupted in 1592, when serious plague broke out in London, forcing the closure of the theatres. Leading playwrights took to penning languorously erotic poetry to make ends meet: so we have Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece - and Marlowe\u2019s blazing masterpiece, Hero and Leander.<br\/><br\/>\nMarlowe\u2019s poem became more notorious than either of Shakespeare\u2019s, due not only to its homophile provocations but also to the scandal attaching to every aspect of Marlowe\u2019s brief life, violently ended in a mysterious brawl, leaving the poem in an unfinished state.<br\/><br\/>\nThe edition read here includes the wonderful continuation by George Chapman, a versatile playwright: tragedian as well as author of Jonsonian metropolitan comedies: in short, an all-round literary craftsman, whose Homer translation was famously admired by Keats. Chapman excels in extended allegory, but also in pithiest epigram \u2013<br\/><br\/>\n\u201cLove is a golden bubble, full of dreams,<br\/>\nThat waking breaks, and fills us with extremes.\u201d\n<br\/><br\/>\nAll these playwrights come from the generation of grammar-school alumni raised on the secular curriculum of Latin poetry: above all, Ovid \u2013 the source of the story of Hero and Leander, and their \u201clove-death\u201d in the Hellespont.<br\/>\n(Summary by Martin Geeson)<br\/><br\/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/20356","language":"English","copyright_year":"1593","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3853","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/hero_and_leander_mg_librivox\/hero_and_leander_mg_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hero_and_Leander_(poem)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/hero-and-leander-by-christopher-marlowe-and-george-chapman\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:37:07","totaltimesecs":13027,"authors":[{"id":"292","first_name":"George","last_name":"Chapman","dob":"c. 1559","dod":"1634"},{"id":"291","first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Marlowe","dob":"1564","dod":"1593"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/hero_and_leander_mg_librivox","sections":[{"id":"22016","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Printer's Dedication","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"219","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22017","section_number":"1","title":"01 - First Sestiad, part one","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"937","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22018","section_number":"2","title":"02 - First Sestiad, part two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1105","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22019","section_number":"3","title":"03 - First Sestiad, part three","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"537","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22020","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Second Sestiad, part one","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1052","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22021","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Second Sestiad, part two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"766","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22022","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Third Sestiad, part one","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1078","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22023","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Third Sestiad, part two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1160","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22024","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Fourth Sestiad, part one","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1172","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22025","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Fourth Sestiad, part two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"728","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22026","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Fifth Sestiad, part one","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"674","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22027","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Fifth Sestiad, part two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"764","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22028","section_number":"12","title":"12 - Fifth Sestiad, part three","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"417","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22029","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Fifth Sestiad, part four","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"747","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22030","section_number":"14","title":"14 - Sixth Sestiad, part one","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"860","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"22031","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Sixth Sestiad, part two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"811","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"11","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"},{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
