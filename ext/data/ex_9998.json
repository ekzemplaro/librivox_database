{"books":{"2":{"id":"9998","title":"Clouds","description":"Strepsiades is an Athenian burdened with debt from a bad marriage and a spendthrift son.  He resolves to go to the Thinking Shop, where he can purchase lessons from the famous Socrates in ways to manipulate language in order to outwit his creditors in court.  Socrates, represented as a cunning, manipulative, irreverent sophist, has little success with the dull-witted Strepsiades, but is able to teach the old man's son Phidippides a few tricks.  In the end, the play is a cynical, clever commentary on Old Ways vs. New Ways, to the disparagement of the former. - Summary by Expatriate","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8688","language":"English","copyright_year":"1900","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9998","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/archive.org\/compress\/clouds_1506_librivox\/formats=64KBPS MP3&file;=\/clouds_1506_librivox.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Clouds","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-clouds-by-aristophanes\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:38:36","totaltimesecs":5916,"authors":[{"id":"1594","first_name":"","last_name":"Aristophanes","dob":"446","dod":"389 BCE"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/clouds_1506_librivox","sections":[{"id":"343579","section_number":"1","title":"Part I","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/clouds_01_aristophanes_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2119","file_name":"clouds_01_aristophanes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8713","display_name":"Expatriate"}]},{"id":"343580","section_number":"2","title":"Part II","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/clouds_02_aristophanes_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1965","file_name":"clouds_02_aristophanes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8713","display_name":"Expatriate"}]},{"id":"343581","section_number":"3","title":"Part III","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/clouds_03_aristophanes_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1833","file_name":"clouds_03_aristophanes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8713","display_name":"Expatriate"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"4","name":"Classics (Antiquity)"}],"translators":[{"id":"11445","first_name":"William James","last_name":"Hickie","dob":"0","dod":"0"}]}}}
