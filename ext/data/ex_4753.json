{"books":{"14":{"id":"4753","title":"In Ghostly Japan","description":"This collection of 14 stories collected by Lafcadio Hearn, contains Japanese ghost stories, but also several non-fiction pieces. Hearn tries to give a glimpse into the customs of the Japanese, by giving examples of Buddhist Proverbs and explaining the use of incense and the nation wide fascination with poetry. Furthermore, he has again translated several hair-rising ghost stories, like \"A Passional Karma\" about the truly undying love of a young couple.
