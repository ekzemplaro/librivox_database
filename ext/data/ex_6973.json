{"books":{"9":{"id":"6973","title":"Living Alone","description":"This is not a real book. It does not deal with real people, nor should it be read by real people. But there are in the world so many real books already written for the benefit of real people, and there are still so many to be written, that I cannot believe that a little alien book such as this, written for the magically-inclined minority, can be considered too assertive a trespasser. -- Stella Benson (author)<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Published in 1919, and set in London during the First World War, <i>Living Alone<\/i> tells of the meeting of a recluse and a witch, then rambles through magic, morality and aerial dogfights on broomsticks.  There isn't too much in the way of a plot, but with its curious blend of fantasy and practical detail of a country in war-time, it's a charmingly weird novel that I hope will entertain witches, wizards and muggles alike. -- Cori Samuel (narrator)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/14907","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6973","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/livingalone_1209_librivox\/livingalone_1209_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/living-alone-by-stella-benson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:21:41","totaltimesecs":15701,"authors":[{"id":"3290","first_name":"Stella","last_name":"Benson","dob":"1892","dod":"1933"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/livingalone_1209_librivox","sections":[{"id":"105141","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Magic Comes to a Committee","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1166","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105142","section_number":"2","title":"2 - The Committee Comes to Magic","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2135","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105143","section_number":"3","title":"3 - The Everlasting Boy","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1252","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105144","section_number":"4","title":"4 - The Forbidden Sandwich","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1281","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105145","section_number":"5","title":"5 - An Air Raid Seen From Below","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1887","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105146","section_number":"6","title":"6 - An Air Raid Seen From Above","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1527","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105147","section_number":"7","title":"7 - The Faery Farm","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2530","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105148","section_number":"8","title":"8 - The Regrettable Wednesday","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1461","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105149","section_number":"9","title":"9 - The House of Living Alone Moves Away","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2069","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"105150","section_number":"10","title":"10 - The Dweller Alone","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"393","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"13","name":"Fantastic Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
