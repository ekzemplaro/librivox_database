{"books":{"13":{"id":"9879","title":"Uganda's White Man of Work: A Story of Alexander M. Mackay","description":"When Henry Stanley (the famous journalist who went to find David Livingstone) was in Africa, he met a king named Mutesa. This king had started believing his tribe's Ugandan traditions about spirits and devils. Then some Arabs came through and Mutesa converted to Islam. When Mr. Stanley came and told Mutesa about God, Mutesa became a Christian and asked Mr. Stanley to get the English to send back missionaries so he and his tribe could learn more about God. Alexander Mackay was one of those courageous men who answered the call. - Summary by Esther ben Simonides","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ugandaswhitemano00fahs","language":"English","copyright_year":"1907","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9879","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11380","first_name":"Sophia Lyon","last_name":"Fahs","dob":"1876","dod":"1978"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"340269","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction and Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/ugandasmanwork_00_fahs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8677","display_name":"KHand"}]},{"id":"340270","section_number":"1","title":"A Newspaper Man's Interview with a Black King","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/ugandasmanwork_01_fahs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"340271","section_number":"2","title":"What Happened After the News was Read","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/ugandasmanwork_02_fahs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8677","display_name":"KHand"}]},{"id":"340272","section_number":"3","title":"Jungle Roads, Ox-carts, and Fly Bites","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/ugandasmanwork_03_fahs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8677","display_name":"KHand"}]},{"id":"340273","section_number":"4","title":"Two Receptions at the Royal Palace","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/ugandasmanwork_04_fahs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"340274","section_number":"5","title":"White Men and Black Men Become Acquainted","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/ugandasmanwork_05_fahs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10662","display_name":"Bethesda Lily"}]},{"id":"340275","section_number":"6","title":"The King and the Wizard","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/kilteddragon\/ugandasmanwork_06_fahs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9092","display_name":"Teresa Bauman"}]},{"id":"340276","section_number":"7","title":"The Two-Faced Mutesa and the Mohammedans","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"340277","section_number":"8","title":"The New Teaching Makes New Men","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"340278","section_number":"9","title":"Mackay's Queer New Name","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"340279","section_number":"10","title":"Three Boy Heroes and One Boy Tyrant","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"340280","section_number":"11","title":"Sturdy Black Christians with Nerve","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"340281","section_number":"12","title":"The White Man of Work Lays Down His Tools","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"340282","section_number":"13","title":"Postlude: Did it Pay?","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"},{"id":"129","name":"Christianity - Biographies"},{"id":"138","name":"Exploration"}],"translators":[]}}}
