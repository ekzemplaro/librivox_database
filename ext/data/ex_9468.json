{"books":{"10":{"id":"9468","title":"My Mother and I","description":"Elizabeth Stern was two and a half years old, when her family emigrated from Poland to Pittsburgh. <i>My Mother and I<\/i> is the story of Stern's Americanization and how it ultimately alienated her from her parents. Stern's father had been a small village rabbi. Strict and traditional in his views, he sends Elizabeth to learn Hebrew at age four, so she can fulfill her destiny \"as the wife of a rabbi or scholar,\" but he opposes letting her attend high school. Stern's mother tries fitfully to pry open doors for her daughter. When Stern's father finds Elizabeth reading a secular book, and, in a fit of rage, flings the offending novel onto the top of a tall bookcase, her mother climbs on a chair and retrieves it for her. But Stern's mother never learns English even as it becomes her daughter\u2019s primary language--and she is burdened by endless pregnancies (she ultimately bears 11 children, only the first 4 of whom survive). Stern's relationship with her mother is loving, but when Elizabeth goes to college, they draw apart. Her mother becomes a \"shadowy figure,\" standing with \"questioning, puzzled eyes\", eyes in which there is love, \"but no understanding, and always an infinite loneliness.\" - Summary by Sue Anderson","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/mymotherandi00stergoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9468","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/mymotherandi_1503_librivox\/mymotherandi_1503_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/my-mother-and-i-by-elizabeth-gertrude-stern\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:36:31","totaltimesecs":12991,"authors":[{"id":"11036","first_name":"Elizabeth Gertrude","last_name":"Stern","dob":"1889","dod":"1954"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/mymotherandi_1503_librivox","sections":[{"id":"327251","section_number":"1","title":"Foreward, The Kitchen","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_01_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1404","file_name":"mymotherandi_01_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327252","section_number":"2","title":"Playing Was Forbidden, Letters to Home","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_02_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1430","file_name":"mymotherandi_02_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327254","section_number":"3","title":"The American Flag, A Baby Sister","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_03_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1229","file_name":"mymotherandi_03_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327253","section_number":"4","title":"The Little Grey House, Little Women","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_04_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1253","file_name":"mymotherandi_04_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327255","section_number":"5","title":"Girls Don't Go To High School","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_05_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1471","file_name":"mymotherandi_05_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327256","section_number":"6","title":"A Sabbath Room","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_06_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1315","file_name":"mymotherandi_06_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327257","section_number":"7","title":"College and the Cost of Dowries","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_07_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1148","file_name":"mymotherandi_07_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327258","section_number":"8","title":"A 21st Birthday Party","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_08_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"894","file_name":"mymotherandi_08_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327259","section_number":"9","title":"Leaving Home","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_09_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1113","file_name":"mymotherandi_09_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327260","section_number":"10","title":"New York, Marriage","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_10_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1006","file_name":"mymotherandi_10_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"327261","section_number":"11","title":"Mother Visits Her Grandson","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/mymotherandi_11_stern_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"728","file_name":"mymotherandi_11_stern_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"111","name":"Memoirs"}],"translators":[]}}}
