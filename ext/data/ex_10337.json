{"books":{"13":{"id":"10337","title":"Revolutions of Time","description":"<br \/>Time flows in a circular motion, repeating itself in \"seasons\" much like a year on earth, each one with the same general events. Because of this, the geological record shows not the immediate past, but the events of the last \"season\" or age, making the fossils and formations show what will happen rather than what has happened. Jehu is transported to the end of his age by the mysterious Lord of the Past, and finds himself caught in the middle of a society at war over how to divert the Big Bang that their science foretells. What follows is, as they say, history. - Summary by Andrea Ika<br \/><br \/>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8735","language":"English","copyright_year":"2003","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10337","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"none","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11635","first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Dunn","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"353783","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1: Past and Present","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/ruthieg\/revolutionsoftime_01_dunn_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353784","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2: Predestined Deja Vu","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/ruthieg\/revolutionsoftime_02_dunn_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353785","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3: Zards and Canitaurs","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/ruthieg\/revolutionsoftime_03_dunn_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353786","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4: Onan, Lord of the Past","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353787","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353788","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353789","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353790","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353791","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353792","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353793","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353794","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353795","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]},{"id":"353796","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10361","display_name":"William Hahn"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"30","name":"Science Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
