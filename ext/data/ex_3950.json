In the isles, Oison married the beautiful Sidhe Niamh: together they traveled, feasted, and quested. At last Oison succumbs to the temptation to return and visit the lands of mortal men: inadvertently slipping from his faerie horse, his body touches the ground and instantly puts on the flesh of a decrepit old man. <br\/><br\/>\n\nOison describes various islands and what he did there: contrasting his noble deeds with the degenerate weakness of the present generation. <br\/><br\/>\n\n(Summary by Godsend)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/poeticalworksofw01yeat","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3950","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/wanderings_oisin_1001_librivox\/wanderings_oisin_1001_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-wanderings-of-oisin-by-william-butler-yeats\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:51:33","totaltimesecs":3093,"authors":[{"id":"335","first_name":"William Butler","last_name":"Yeats","dob":"1865","dod":"1939"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/wanderings_oisin_1001_librivox","sections":[{"id":"25037","section_number":"1","title":"Book 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1058","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"25038","section_number":"2","title":"Book 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"789","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"25039","section_number":"3","title":"Book 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1246","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"11","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"},{"id":"69","name":"Narratives"}],"translators":[]}}}
