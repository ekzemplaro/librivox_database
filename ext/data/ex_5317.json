{"books":{"25":{"id":"5317","title":"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria","description":"Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1873 \u2013 March 2, 1936) was a Scottish journalist and prolific writer on religion, mythology and anthropology in the early 20th century. His works included Indian Myth and Legend, Celtic Folklore and Myths of China and Japan.\r\nAs well as writing books, articles and poems, he often gave lectures, and also broadcast talks on Celtic mythology.\r\n\r\nThis volume deals with the myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria, and as these reflect the civilization in which they developed, a historical narrative has been provided, beginning with the early Sumerian Age and concluding with the periods of the Persian and Grecian Empires. Over thirty centuries of human progress are thus passed under review.\r\n(Summary extracted from Wikipedia and the Preface of this book)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/16653","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5317","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/myths_of_babylonia_1201_librivox\/myths_of_babylonia_1201_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/myths-and-legends-myths-of-babylonia-and-assyria-by-donald-alexander-mackenzie\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"16:13:58","totaltimesecs":58438,"authors":[{"id":"1941","first_name":"Donald Alexander","last_name":"Mackenzie","dob":"1873","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/myths_of_babylonia_1201_librivox","sections":[{"id":"61313","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
