{"books":{"32":{"id":"10820","title":"With Christ in the School of Prayer","description":"\u201cWe have become so accustomed to limit the wonderful love and the large promises of our God, that we cannot read the simplest and clearest statements of our Lord without the qualifying clauses by which we guard and expound them\u201d.  This is what Andrew Murray writes in the preface to this practical and scriptural volume on the practice of prayer.  This book has been of tremendous help to generations of believers as they have sought a more effective prayer life.  It opens with the words of the disciples, \u201cLord, teach us to pray\u201d.  And so opens the school of prayer to which believers are invited. - Summary by Christopher Smith","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/withchristinscho00murr","language":"English","copyright_year":"1895","num_sections":"33","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10820","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2839","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Murray","dob":"1828","dod":"1917"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"368179","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/prayerschool_00_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"368180","section_number":"1","title":"01 -  Lord! teach us to pray; or, The Only Teacher","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/prayerschool_01_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"368181","section_number":"2","title":"02 - In spirit and truth; or, The True Worshippers","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/prayerschool_02_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"368182","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Pray to thy Father, which is in secret; or, Alone with God","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/prayerschool_03_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"368183","section_number":"4","title":"04 - After this manner pray; or, The Model Prayer","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/prayerschool_04_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"368184","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Ask, and it shall be given you; or, the Certainty of the Answer to Prayer","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/prayerschool_05_murray_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7424","display_name":"Christopher Smith"}]},{"id":"368185","section_number":"6","title":"06 - How much more?
