{"books":{"11":{"id":"6071","title":"Sex and Common-Sense","description":"I always want to remind people of this truism when they have first come into contact with sex in some horrible and shameful way. That is one of the greatest misfortunes that can happen to any of us, and unfortunately it happens to many. Boys and girls are allowed to grow up in ignorance. The girls perhaps know nothing till they have to know all. The boys learn from grimy sources. I was speaking on this subject at one of our great universities the other day, and afterwards many of the men came and talked to me privately. With hardly a single exception they said to me\u2014\"Our parents told us nothing. We have never heard sex spoken of except in a dirty way.\" (Summary by, A.
