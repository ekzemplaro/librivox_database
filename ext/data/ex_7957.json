He writes successful crime fiction stories, but this doesn't pay enough for him to do the things he wants. Things change when he starts to put his knowledge of crime to a practical use... It gets him into serious trouble before long. (Summary by Anna Simon)\n(This work was first published in the USA in 1918, and falls under the Rule of the Shorter Term).
