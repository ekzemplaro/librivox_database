These are short reads of 5 to 15 minutes in length, good for newbies, by good but minor pulp fiction writers of the day, including Agnes Brogan, Pauline Richards, Warren Miller, Clarissa Mackie, Xeno Pullman, and others.  Pullman wrote a couple of non-fiction works on farm equipment; Mackie was a prolific writer whose work appeared in several magazines and newspapers.
