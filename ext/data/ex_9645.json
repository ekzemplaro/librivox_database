{"books":{"21":{"id":"9645","title":"Secrets of the Woods","description":"The unique merit of this nature student rests in his fascinating style of writing, which invariably interests young and old; for without this element his pioneer work in the realm of nature would now be familiar only to scientists, introducing people everywhere into the wonderland of nature hitherto entirely closed to all.\n\nThis is another chapter in the shy, wild life of the fields and woods. Little Toohkees, the wood mouse that dies of fright in the author\u2019s hand; the mother otter, Keeonekh, teaching her little ones to swim; and the little red squirrel with his many curious habits,\u2014all are presented with the same liveliness and color that characterize the descriptions in the first two volumes. The stories are unusually accurate in portraying animal life as it really exists in its native haunts.\n\nContaining many details of the lives of animals that you may never have known of before, these wilderness stories are great listening for young and old.
