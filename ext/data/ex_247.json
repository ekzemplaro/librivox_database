{"books":{"12":{"id":"247","title":"Seven Little Australians","description":"This is the story of seven incorrigible children living near Sydney in the 1880\u2019s with their military-man father, and a stepmother who is scarcely older than the oldest child of the family. A favourite amongst generations of children for over a century, this story tells of the cheeky exploits of Meg, Pip, Judy, Bunty, Nell, Baby, and The General (who is the real baby of the family), as well as providing a fascinating insight into Australian family life in a bygone era.
