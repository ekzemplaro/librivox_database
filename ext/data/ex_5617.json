{"books":{"8":{"id":"5617","title":"Paying Guest","description":"George Gissing was one of the most accomplished writers of realism in the Victorian Era. Also <i>The Paying Guest<\/i> is a great example of realism, which closely pictures the class struggles of the time. The Novel opens at the breakfast table of the Mumfords, when Mr. Mumford draws the attention of his wife to an advertisement in the newspaper of a young lady searching a home with a respectable, well-connected family in London. After some consideration, the Mumfords decide to answer to the advertisment, and a few weeks later, Miss Derrick moves in with them. Tensions are inevitable.
