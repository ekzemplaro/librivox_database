{"books":{"107":{"id":"9761","title":"Rilla of Ingleside","description":"Anne of Green Gables is all grown up and married, and this is the story of her daughter \u201cRilla\u201d, named for the indomitable Marilla Cuthbert of Anne\u2019s childhood. The young Rilla will need all her strength for the dark days ahead, as her coming of age will be in the midst of World War I. Her brothers and sweetheart will go to war, and not all of them will come back. Her sisters will become nurses, but Rilla herself is too young. What can she do back home to support the war effort? How can she be involved in doing good in her own backyard? What difference can one person\u2019s \u2018keeping the faith\u2019 make in the titanic struggle of world events?\n\nLM Montgomery, in this final installment of the Anne of Green Gables books, takes us through the terror, the suspense and the sacrifices of \u2018The Great War\u2019 as told through the eyes of Rilla. Of course, as in any girl\u2019s diary, there are also chronicled the romances of Miranda, Gertrude, Mary and Rilla herself. At the same time, the small details of everyday life lighten the drama with humorous stories of the antics of the Ingleside cat, the putting on of a wedding with one day\u2019s notice and \u2018that prayer meeting\u2019 which will forever go down in the local lore of little Glen St Mary! - Summary by Beth
