{"books":{"15":{"id":"8819","title":"Tales of a Poultry Farm","description":"Another interesting book by Clara Dillingham Pierson, this time focusing on the poultry you might have in your farmyard! The chickens, ducks, and turkeys get some new experiences as a new owner comes to the farm, and does some things that seem very odd to them. Learn along with the chickens about the new owner, and also some other things that are worse, like the awful hook worms that some young chickens experienced when they disobeyed their mom. This book is just as interesting as the others by this author, so enjoy living in the poultry yard for a while!
