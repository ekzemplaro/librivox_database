A large part of the book consists of five sermons delivered by Moses reviewing the previous forty years of wandering in the wilderness, and the future entering into the Promised Land. Its central element is a detailed law-code by which the Israelites are to live within the Promised Land. Theologically the book constitutes the renewing of the covenant between YHWH, the Jewish God, and the 'Children of Israel.'\" <br\/>(Summary by Wikipedia) <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/ebible.org\/asv\/Deut.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4697","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/bible_asv_05_deuteronomy_ss_1010_librivox\/bible_asv_05_deuteronomy_ss_1010_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/deuteronomy-by-american-standard-version-1010\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:47:05","totaltimesecs":10025,"authors":[{"id":"187","first_name":"","last_name":"American Standard Version","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/bible_asv_05_deuteronomy_ss_1010_librivox","sections":[{"id":"45489","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Chapters 01-03 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1100","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45490","section_number":"2","title":"2 - Chapters 04-06 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1100","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45491","section_number":"3","title":"3 - Chapters 07-09 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"856","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45492","section_number":"4","title":"4 - Chapters 10-13 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1116","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45493","section_number":"5","title":"5 - Chapters 14-17 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"993","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45494","section_number":"6","title":"6 - Chapters 18-21 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"886","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45495","section_number":"7","title":"7 - Chapters 22-25","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"976","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45496","section_number":"8","title":"8 - Chapters 26-30","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1712","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"45497","section_number":"9","title":"9 - Chapters 31-34","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1286","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"79","name":"Bibles"}],"translators":[]}}}
