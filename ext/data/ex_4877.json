{"books":{"1":{"id":"4877","title":"World That Couldn't Be","description":"Layard was a curiosity to sociologists. The planet supported thriving tribes of natives but they were genderless. How could tribes form without families? But Gavin Duncan didn\u2019t care. He had come to Layard to farm vua plants. Their berries cured mental illnesses and were one of the most expensive commodities in the galaxy. He was going to make his fortune if he could just keep the Cytha at bay, a big, dumb animal that could munch through 10 rows of vua in a night. Despite native superstitions he was going to have to hunt and kill the pest if he was to protect his crop. It was a dim-witted beast. How hard could it be? \u2013 \u201cThe World That Couldn\u2019t Be\u201d was first published in the January 1958 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine.
