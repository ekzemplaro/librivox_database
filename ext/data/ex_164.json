{"books":{"19":{"id":"164","title":"Domestic Cookery, Useful Receipts, and Hints to Young Housekeepers","description":"<p>The compiler of [this book] having entered early in life upon a train of duties, was frequently embarrassed by her ignorance of domestic affairs. For, whilst receipt books for elegant preparations were often seen, those connected with the ordinary, but far more useful part of household duties, were not easily procured; thus situated, she applied to persons of experience, and embodied the information collected in a book, to which, since years have matured her judgment, she has added much that is the result of her own experiments.<p>Familiar, then, with the difficulties a young housekeeper encounters, when she finds herself in reality the mistress of an establishment, the Authoress offers to her young countrywomen this Work, with the belief that, by attention to its contents, many of the cares attendant on a country or city life, may be materially lessened; and hoping that the directions are such as to be understood by the most inexperienced, it is respectfully dedicated to those who feel an interest in domestic affairs.<p>Summary by the Authoress.<\/p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/9101","language":"English","copyright_year":"1866","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/164","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/domestic_cookery_librivox\/domestic_cookery_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/domestic-cookery-by-elizabeth-e-lea","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:47:06","totaltimesecs":31626,"authors":[{"id":"4124","first_name":"
