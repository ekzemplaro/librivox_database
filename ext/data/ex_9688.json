{"books":{"16":{"id":"9688","title":"Charge of the Light Brigade","description":"This poem was published just six weeks after the event, its lines emphasize the valour of the cavalry in bravely carrying out their orders, regardless of the obvious outcome. \nThe Charge of the Light Brigade was a charge of British light cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. Lord Raglan, overall commander of the British forces, had intended to send the Light Brigade to pursue and harry a retreating Russian artillery battery, a task well-suited to light cavalry. Due to miscommunication in the chain of command, the Light Brigade was instead sent on a frontal assault against a different artillery battery, one well-prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire.(Summary from Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/246\/386.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9688","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/charge_of_the_light_brigade_1503.poem_librivox\/charge_of_the_light_brigade_1503.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-charge-of-the-light-brigade-by-alfred-lord-tennyson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:42:02","totaltimesecs":2522,"authors":[{"id":"487","first_name":"Alfred, Lord","last_name":"Tennyson","dob":"1809","dod":"1892"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/charge_of_the_light_brigade_1503.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"333970","section_number":"1","title":"Charge of the Light Brigade -
