{"books":{"21":{"id":"6282","title":"Vagabond","description":" LibriVox volunteers bring you 22 recordings of The Vagabond by Robert Louis Stevenson. This was the Weekly Poetry project for January 22, 2012.<br><br>The Vagabond appeared in Stevenson's Songs of Travel and Other Verses, which was published after his death. It expresses the love of travel and adventure he always nurtured. Near the end of his life Stevenson emigrated to Samoa and became very involved in local politics, severely criticising the European officials he encountered. He was buried close to his new home, in the land he had come to love.
