{"books":{"19":{"id":"9334","title":"Short Story Collection Vol. 060","description":"This collection is for any short story in the English Language in the public domain, preferably less than 60 minutes. You are welcome to contribute as many as you wish, and there is no need to \"sign-up\" before recording as long as the work is clearly in the public domain.\n\nPlease ask here if the story was published after 1922 or if you are unsure for any other reason about its public domain status. Note that translations attract their own new copyright and must also have been published before 1923.\n\nMultiple versions are always welcome, so you can record a story that has been recorded before. (If the same stories are submitted twice in the same collection, we will carry the second version over to the next collection) .\n\nYou may prefer to submit your recording to one of the other more specialised short story collections.  - Summary by Ruth
