{"books":{"14":{"id":"7549","title":"No Surrender","description":"The plot of this novel is a thin cover for what the book really intends to offer: a view into the lives, plight and opponents of the Suffragists from the point of view of a woman who was a Suffragist herself, while the movement was at it's height, still fighting for the right of women to vote.<BR>Jenny is a mill girl. She joins the Suffragists because she knows that the women's lot has to change, and quickly: as a woman in a man's world, she earns much less than her male colleagues, and her sister is married to an abusive husband and has no word in the education of her children. Mary is a daughter of a mill owner. She sees things for what they are. Jenny and Mary become friends during the fight. The author doesn't lose the chance to describe the lot of factory girls.<BR>This book is extremely important. First, upon publication, as a novel, it could bring the subject of the Suffragists - which was hot at that time- to the attention of more people and, hopefully, convert them to the cause. Now, 100 years later, when we know the outcome, we are bringing to you the plight of these strong and admirable women.
