{"books":{"12":{"id":"7549","title":"Why Crime Does Not Pay","description":"The publishers believe that a picture of a life sketched by a master hand-somebody who stands in the world of crime as Edison does in his field or Morgan and Rockefeller do in theirs-could not fail to be impressive and valuable and prove the oft repeated statement that crime does not pay.\n<br><br>\nSuch a person is Sophie Lyons, the most remarkable and the greatest criminal of modern times.
