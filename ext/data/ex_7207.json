{"books":{"3":{"id":"7207","title":"Watchbird","description":"3 Robert Sheckley short stories that demonstrate the breathof his fantastic imagination.  In Watchbird, the question \"can machines solve human problems?\" is answered with a resounding YES! But there may be a few unforeseen glitches.  Just a few. Warrior Race drops us into an alien race of warriors who fight in a way you will never be able to imagine until you listen.  And Beside Still Waters is a gentle story that shows us a man who really wants to get away from it all ... sitting on a rock in the asteroid belt with only a robot for a friend.  No girls allowed!  A poignant and unsettling story to say the least.
