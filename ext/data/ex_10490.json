{"books":{"37":{"id":"10490","title":"Columbia Accident Investigation Board Final Report, Volume 1","description":"In 1981, Columbia became the first spacecraft of its type to fly in Earth orbit and successfully completed 27 missions over more than two decades. During the STS-107 mission, Columbia and its crew traveled more than six million miles in 16 days. The Orbiter\u02bcs destruction, just 16 minutes before scheduled touchdown, shows that space flight is still far from routine. It involves a substantial element of risk, which must be recognized, but never accepted with resignation. The seven Columbia astronauts believed that the risk was worth the reward. The Board salutes their courage and dedicates this report to their memory. - Summary by from the Board Report\n\nNote: Volumes 2-6 are supporting documents and transcripts not included in this
