{"books":{"3":{"id":"5455","title":"Bible (KJV) 21: Ecclesiastes","description":"The book of Ecclesiastes is a wonderful book. It tells how all man's doing is futile, if it is done in his own strength. The last two verses sum it up quite nicely: \"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
