{"books":{"7":{"id":"10027","title":"Monologues From: Henry lV Part 1","description":"Henry IV, formerly known as Bolingbroke, has taken the crown of England from Richard II and sent the former king to his death. But Henry finds that the cares of state are equal to, if not greater than, its boons. Troubled with wars and the threat of rebellion, Henry also despairs of the kind of company his eldest son - Prince Hal - keeps, not least of which, either in size or wit, is the scurrilous old knight Sir John Falstaff. When the gallant and raging Hotspur of the North leads an army in rebellion against the King, will the young Prince Hal find his own fire inside and \"imitate the sun\" in its glory, or will his family line be crushed into oblivion, just as King Richard was? - Summary by Anadaxis","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1780","language":"English","copyright_year":"1598","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10027","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Henry_IV,_Part_1","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"37","first_name":"William","last_name":"Shakespeare","dob":"1554","dod":"1616"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"344675","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]},{"id":"344676","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]},{"id":"344677","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]},{"id":"344678","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]},{"id":"344679","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]},{"id":"344680","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]},{"id":"344681","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]},{"id":"344682","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10141","display_name":"karinadm"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"58","name":"Drama"}],"translators":[]}}}
