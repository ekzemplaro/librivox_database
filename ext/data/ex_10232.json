{"books":{"10":{"id":"10232","title":"September","description":"Michael Field was a pseudonym used for the poetry and verse drama of Katharine Harris Bradley (27 October 1846 \u2013 26 September 1914) and her niece and ward Edith Emma Cooper (12 January 1862 \u2013 13 December 1913). As Field they wrote around 40 works together, and a long journal Works and Days. Their intention was to keep the pen-name secret, but it became public knowledge, not long after they had confided in their friend Robert Browning. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/field02.html#3","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10232","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/september_1509.poem_librivox\/september_1509.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/september-by-michael-field\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:13:36","totaltimesecs":816,"authors":[{"id":"9975","first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Field","dob":"1862\/1846","dod":"1913\/1914"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/september_1509.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"350728","section_number":"1","title":"September - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/september_field_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"85","file_name":"september_field_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"350736","section_number":"2","title":"September - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/september_field_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"70","file_name":"september_field_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"350732","section_number":"3","title":"September - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/september_field_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"73","file_name":"september_field_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"350731","section_number":"4","title":"September - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/september_field_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"80","file_name":"september_field_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"350727","section_number":"5","title":"September - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/september_field_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"72","file_name":"september_field_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"350737","section_number":"6","title":"September - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/september_field_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"66","file_name":"september_field_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
