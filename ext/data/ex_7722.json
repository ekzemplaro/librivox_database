{"books":{"34":{"id":"7722","title":"Melting Pot","description":"Russian-Jew David Quixano has come to America after surviving a pogrom which has killed his family. He has written a symphony which embodies his vision of America as a melting pot, into which people from all the nations of the earth come, and \"the great Alchemist melts and fuses them with his purging flame! Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God.\" But old hatreds and old sins die hard.... \n<i>Note: There are attitudes and terms in the play that may be offensive to some listeners.<\/i>\n(Summary by
