{"books":{"19":{"id":"2289","title":"Gulliver of Mars","description":"<p>This escapist novel first published in 1905 as Lieutenant Gullivar Jones: His Vacation follows the exploits of American Navy Lieutenant Gulliver Jones, a bold, if slightly hapless, hero who is magically transported to Mars; where he almost outwits his enemies, almost gets the girl, and almost saves the day.\n\nSomewhat of a literary and chronological bridge between H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jones' adventures provide an evocative mix of satire and sword-and-planet adventure.\n(Summary by James Christopher and Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/604","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2289","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/gulliver_of_mars_0905_librivox\/gulliver_of_mars_0905_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lieutenant_Gullivar_Jones:_His_Vacation","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/gulliver-of-mars-by-edwin-l-arnold\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:16:03","totaltimesecs":22563,"authors":[{"id":"875","first_name":"Sir Edwin","last_name":"Arnold","dob":"1832","dod":"1904"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/gulliver_of_mars_0905_librivox","sections":[{"id":"161707","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"733","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161708","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1110","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161709","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1610","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161710","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1301","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161711","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter V","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1420","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161712","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter VI","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"959","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161713","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter VII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1340","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161714","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter VIII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"688","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161715","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter IX","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1088","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161716","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter X","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"873","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161717","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XI","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1127","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161718","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter XII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1052","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161719","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter XIII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1261","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161720","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter XIV","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1245","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161721","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter XV","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1217","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161722","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter XVI","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1090","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161723","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter XVII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1069","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161724","section_number":"18","title":"Chapter XVIII","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1176","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161725","section_number":"19","title":"Chapter XIX","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"647","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]},{"id":"161726","section_number":"20","title":"Chapter XX","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1557","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2294","display_name":"James Christopher"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"30","name":"Science Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
