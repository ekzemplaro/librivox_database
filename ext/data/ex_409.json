{"books":[{"id":"409","title":"Slant Book","description":"<p>This recording of Peter Newell\u2019s The Slant Book (1910) kicks off voiced renderings by LibriVox of public domain books in the International Children's Digital Library (ICDL). <\/p>\n<p>The ICDL book can be found at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.childrenslibrary.org\/icdl\/BookPreview?bookid=newslan_00150052&summary=true&route=alsoby&lang=English&msg;=\">http:\/\/www.childrenslibrary.org\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Slant Book is literally the shape of a parallelogram, with the spine of the book running down one side. When opened, facing pages form a \"V\" shape. All the pictures on the slanted recto pages show a way-too-precocious infant in a carriage [the \"go-cart\" of yesteryear] racing downhill who has somehow gotten away from his nanny, gleefully creating havoc all along the way! The facing verso pages contain two stanzas of commentary on the charming --if alarming!-- illustrations. <\/p>\n<p>This book pioneered the \"special format\" children's literature of today, such as pop-up books or cutout books like Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Newell books from 80 years ago have been reprinted, since Newell has undergone a resurgence in popularity much as Dr. Seuss's books did during the 1980s. This is a boon for teachers and home-schooling parents, since this recording can now be listened to as youngsters page through a real book (ISBN: 080-480-5326) or as they view the ICDL scanned version online (both are a real treat)!
