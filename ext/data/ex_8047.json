{"books":{"9":{"id":"8047","title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (abridged, version 3)","description":"A delightful version of Alice's Adventures following that scurrying Rabbit with the watch that is shortened for the enjoyment of younger children. She meets all of the strange talking animals (and they are just as rude or silly as usual) and eats and drinks from all of the bottles and grows and shrinks alarmingly just like in the longer version. Enjoy.
