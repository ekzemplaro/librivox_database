{"books":{"15":{"id":"9078","title":"Poetry of St John of the Cross","description":"The poems of St John of the Cross, with their mystic depth and spiritual ecstasy, stand among the world's great poems of Divine Love in all traditions.  St John is one of the Roman Catholic Doctors of the Church, was a reformer of the Carmelite Order, and co-founder with St Teresa of Avila of the Discalced Carmelites.  Teresa invited John to follow her, and in the protocols of the times, also became her Spiritual Director and Confessor.  Many of their individual works could be considered the products of their mutual support and inspiration.   - Summary by Ed
