{"books":{"20":{"id":"9547","title":"Heptameron of the tales of Margaret, Queen of Navarre","description":"THE HEPTAMERON (here Volume 4 of 5), first published posthumously in 1558, is divided into seven complete days containing 10 stories each, and an eighth day containing only 2 stories. The stories, many of which deal with love and infidelity, resulted in \"accusations of looseness\" by critics of the day. The author, Margaret of Navarre (also known as Margaret of Angoul\u00eame) became an influential woman in the intellectual and cultural circles of the French Renaissance.\n\nFrom an 1892 essay by the translator George Saintsbury: \"In so large a number of stories with so great a variety of subjects, it naturally cannot but be the case that there is a considerable diversity of tone. But that peculiarity at which we have glanced more than once, the combination of voluptuous passion with passionate regret and a mystical devotion, is seldom absent for long together...The question, What is the special virtue of the Heptameron? I have myself little hesitation in answering. There is no book, in prose and of so early a date, which shows to me the characteristic of the time as it influenced the two great literary nations of Europe so distinctly as this book of Margaret of Angoul\u00eame\u2026\" - Summary by  adapted from Wikipedia and excerpted from the text by lubee930)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/17704","language":"English","copyright_year":"1898","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9547","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heptam\u00e9ron","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"6118","first_name":"","last_name":"Marguerite of Navarre","dob":"1492","dod":"1549"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"329558","section_number":"1","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329559","section_number":"2","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXII","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/heptameron4_02_margueriteofnavarre_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"329560","section_number":"3","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329561","section_number":"4","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXIV","listen_url":"http:\/\/uploads.librivox.org\/icequeen\/heptameron4_04_margueriteofnavarre_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"329562","section_number":"5","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXV","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329563","section_number":"6","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXVI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"329564","section_number":"7","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXVII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9856","display_name":"KarenCecilia"}]},{"id":"329565","section_number":"8","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXVIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329566","section_number":"9","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XXXIX","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329567","section_number":"10","title":"Fourth Day, Tale XL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329568","section_number":"11","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329569","section_number":"12","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329570","section_number":"13","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329571","section_number":"14","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLIV","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329572","section_number":"15","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLV","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329573","section_number":"16","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLVI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329574","section_number":"17","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLVII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329575","section_number":"18","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLVIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329576","section_number":"19","title":"Fifth Day, Tale XLIX","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329577","section_number":"20","title":"Fifth Day, Tale L","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"329578","section_number":"21","title":"Appendix to Volume 4","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/heptameron4_21_margaretofnavarre_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"20","name":"Literary Fiction"},{"id":"52","name":"Published before 1800"},{"id":"76","name":"Single Author Collections"}],"translators":[{"id":"7121","first_name":" George","last_name":"Saintsbury","dob":"1845","dod":"1933"}]}}}
