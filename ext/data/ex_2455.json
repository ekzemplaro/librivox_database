{"books":{"11":{"id":"2455","title":"Tom Swift and His War Tank","description":"<p>Tom Swift, that prolific youthful inventor, is engaged in trying to help the Allies win WWI. After reading newspaper accounts of the British tanks, Tom takes a sheet of paper and sets out to design a better one from scratch. And fortunately, he can throw the whole family business behind his venture.<br \/><br \/>He has two problems: First, his friends and acquaintances are questioning his patriotism because he hasn't enlisted as a rifleman for the front lines. Even his girl is worried his blood isn't true-blue. But that's because he is developing his tank in secret, and they don't know he's concentrating on winning the war the American way, with machines.<br \/><br \/>The second problem is that the German spies have penetrated the secret of what is being built in the high-security shop on the Swift property. And they will stop at nothing to steal its design - not kidnapping Tom, and not kidnapping the tank itself, complete with crew.<br \/><br \/>Tom and his buddies had better work fast, or the American riflemen are going to find the Kaiser's soldiers using American-designed tanks against them!

Smith)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/954","language":"English","copyright_year":"1918","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2455","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/tom_swift_and_his_war_tank_0809\/tom_swift_and_his_war_tank_0809_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tom_Swift_and_His_War_Tank","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/tom-swift-and-his-war-tank-by-victor-appleton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:38:06","totaltimesecs":16686,"authors":[{"id":"972","first_name":"Victor","last_name":"Appleton","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/tom_swift_and_his_war_tank_0809","sections":[{"id":"165107","section_number":"1","title":"Chapters 1 & 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1509","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"204","display_name":"Mark F.
