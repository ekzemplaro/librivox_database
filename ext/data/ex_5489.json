{"books":{"17":{"id":"5489","title":"Summer (version 2)","description":"Wharton's 1917 novella Summer, like her more famous work Ethan Frome, is set in a very small rural New England town.  Charity Royall longs to escape the claustrophobic confines of North Dormer and the inappropriate advances of her guardian Mr. Royall, who adopted her as a child from the nearby Mountain community.  Hope arrives in the form of city boy Lucius Harney, who has come to research the architecture of the region; but will his presence in Charity's life mean her salvation - or her undoing?
