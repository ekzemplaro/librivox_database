She published a number of novels (all at her own expense) and in addition to being a novelist was a poet, her best known being <em>Visiting Westminster Abbey<\/em> which begins:<br \/><br \/>\nHoly Moses!<br \/>\nTake a look!<br \/>\nFlesh decayed in every nook!<br \/>\nSome rare bits of brain lie here,<br \/>\nMortal loads of beef and beer.<br \/><br \/>\nThe best account of her life available on the web is probably <a href=\"http:\/\/oddbooks.co.uk\/amanda\/life.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/oddbooks.co.uk\/amanda\/life.html<\/a>. C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and The Inklings were admirers and held competitions to see who could read her work for the longest time whist keeping a straight face. Sadly, all her books are now out of print but command high prices on the rare books market.<br \/><br \/>\n<em>Irene Iddesleigh<\/em>, her first book, is a romantic novel, telling the common story of an unhappy, doomed marriage. The prose style however is unique.
