{"books":{"39":{"id":"6618","title":"Nibelungenlied","description":"The Nibelungenlied, translated as The Song of the Nibelungs, is an epic poem in Middle High German. The story tells of dragon-slayer Siegfried at the court of the Burgundians, how he was murdered, and of his wife Kriemhild's revenge.<br><br>\n\nThe Nibelungenlied is based on pre-Christian Germanic heroic motifs (the \"Nibelungensaga\"), which include oral traditions and reports based on historic events and individuals of the 5th and 6th centuries. Old Norse parallels of the legend survive in the V\u00f6lsunga saga, the Prose Edda, the Poetic Edda, the Legend of Norna-Gest, and the \u00dei\u00f0rekssaga.<br><br>\n\nThe present translator has endeavored to translate literally and accurately, and to reproduce the spirit of the original, as far as a prose translation will permit. To this end the language has been made as simple and as Saxon in character as possible. An exception has been made, however, in the case of such Romance words as were in use in England during the age of the romances of chivalry, and which would help to land a Romance coloring; these have been frequently employed. Very few obsolete words have been used, and these are explained in the notes, but the language has been made to some extent archaic, especially in dialogue, in order to give the impression of age.
