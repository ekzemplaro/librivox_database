{"books":{"26":{"id":"10467","title":"Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi Valley","description":"\"It has long been a desideratum to have in English the early narratives, of the discovery and exploration of the Mississippi. Marquette's map and voyage have indeed appeared, but the narrative varies in no small degree from the authentic manuscript, and the map is not at all a copy of that still preserved, as it came from the hand of the great explorer. These published from original manuscripts, and accompanied by the narratives of the missionaries in La Salle's expedition, are now first presented in an accessible shape, and complete the annals of the exploration.\n\nThe life of Marquette, and the history of the exploration itself, are the result of many years study of the early Spanish and French authorities, both printed and manuscript, some of which have never before been consulted.\" - Summary by the Author","url_text_source":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/cihm_42407","language":"English","copyright_year":"1852","num_sections":"27","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10467","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11734","first_name":"John Gilmary","last_name":"Shea","dob":"1824","dod":"1892"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"357785","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357786","section_number":"1","title":"Pt 1 History of the Discovery Mississippi River","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357787","section_number":"2","title":"Pt 2 History of the Discovery Mississippi River","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357788","section_number":"3","title":"Pt 3 History of the Discovery Mississippi River","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357789","section_number":"4","title":"Pt 1 Life of Father James Marquette","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357790","section_number":"5","title":"Pt 2 Life of Father James Marquette","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357791","section_number":"6","title":"Pt 3 Life of Father James Marquette","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357792","section_number":"7","title":"Notice on the Sieur Jolliet","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357793","section_number":"8","title":"Notice on Father Dablon, Pt 1 Voyages and Discoveries of Father James Marquette","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357794","section_number":"9","title":"Pt 2 Voyages and Discoveries of Father James Marquette","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357795","section_number":"10","title":"Footnote on the Character of the Illinois","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357796","section_number":"11","title":"Pt 3 Voyages and Discoveries of Father James Marquette","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357797","section_number":"12","title":"Pt 4 Voyages and Discoveries of Father James Marquette","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357798","section_number":"13","title":"Narrative of a Voyage Made to the Illinois by Father Claude Allouez","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357799","section_number":"14","title":"Bibliographical Notice of the 'Etablissement de la Foi' of Father Christian le Clercq","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5750","display_name":"laurencetrask"}]},{"id":"357800","section_number":"15","title":"Pt 1 Narrative of the First Attempt by M.
