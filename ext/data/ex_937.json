{"books":{"13":{"id":"937","title":"More William","description":"The second of Crompton's series of 39 books about William Brown, our cheeky 11 year-old protagonist. A hero to some, a dastardly villain to others, this book is structured round a year in his life. Starting with William waking up on Christmas morning and ending with him going to sleep the following Christmas Eve, there are the usual round of misadventures, misunderstanding and general mayhem in between. When a boy like William wakes up under a motto that says \"A Busy Day Is A Happy Day\" alongside a copy of \"Things A Boy Can Do\", the chaos is just around the corner. Includes the very first William short story - \"Rice Mould\". Often dismissed as childrens literature, the first few books of William stories were probably aimed more at an adult audience. They resonate with a distinctly English humour, but there are obvious echoes from 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Huckleberry Finn'.<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/17125","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/937","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/more_william_ks_librivox\/more_william_ks_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/More_William","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/more-william-by-richmal-crompton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:20:46","totaltimesecs":19246,"authors":[{"id":"759","first_name":"Richmal","last_name":"Crompton","dob":"1890","dod":"1969"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/more_william_ks_librivox","sections":[{"id":"135486","section_number":"1","title":"A Busy Day","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1889","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135487","section_number":"2","title":"Rice-Mould","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1558","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135488","section_number":"3","title":"William's Burglar","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1431","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135489","section_number":"4","title":"The Knight at Arms","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"892","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135490","section_number":"5","title":"William's Hobby","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"830","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135491","section_number":"6","title":"The Rivals","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1607","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135492","section_number":"7","title":"The Ghost","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1058","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135493","section_number":"8","title":"The May King","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1410","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135494","section_number":"9","title":"The Revenge","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"998","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135495","section_number":"10","title":"The Helper","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1301","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135496","section_number":"11","title":"William and the Smuggler","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1911","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135497","section_number":"12","title":"The Reform of William","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1262","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135498","section_number":"13","title":"William and the Ancient Souls","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1057","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"135499","section_number":"14","title":"William's Christmas Eve","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2042","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"},{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"},{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"}],"translators":[]}}}
