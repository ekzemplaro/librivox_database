{"books":{"8":{"id":"1783","title":"Life of Charlemagne","description":"<p>Notker's work consists of anecdotes relating chiefly to the Emperor Charlemagne and his family. It was written for Charles the Fat, great-grandson of Charlemagne, who visited Saint Gall in 883. Traditionally, it has been scorned by traditional historians, who refer to the Monk as one who \"took pleasure in amusing anecdotes and witty tales, but who was ill-informed about the true march of historical events\". However, several of the Monk's tales, such as that of the nine rings of the Avar stronghold, have been used in modern biographies of Charlemagne.
