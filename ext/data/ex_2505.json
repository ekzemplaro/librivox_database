{"books":{"8":{"id":"2505","title":"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions","description":"<br \/><i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions<\/i> is an 1884 science fiction novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott. As a satire, <i>Flatland<\/i> offered pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. However, the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described <i>Flatland<\/i> as \"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\" As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics and computer science students.
