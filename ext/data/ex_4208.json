{"books":{"4":{"id":"4208","title":"Selection of Divine Poems","description":"<p>John Donne was an English Jacobean preacher, sometime lawyer, later in life a Member of Parliament and Royal Chaplain. Marrying for love against the wishes of his influential father-in-law; Donne's career was cast into shadow: forcing him to support his wife, Anne, as best he might under a specter of unforgiving penury. <\/p> <p>Despite such hardships - perhaps because of them - Donne's writings demonstrate a mastery of poetry layered with metaphysical meaning and mystery: which continues to delight and challenge modern-day readers. Donne's \"divine poems\" - the focus of this collection - present profound theological insights using absorbing allegories and beautiful imagery. <p><\/p>At the end of Donne's life - as his health deteriorated under illnesses of increasing severity - his poetry served him as: distraction, consolation, and even \"public confession\". With them, Donne cheerfully but soberly faces the limits of his own mortality: and contemplates the mysteries that lie beyond the grave. <\/p><p>(Introduction by Godsend)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/poemsofjohndonne01donn","language":"English","copyright_year":"1650","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4208","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox\/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Holy_Sonnets","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-selection-of-divine-poems-by-john-donne\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:48:33","totaltimesecs":2913,"authors":[{"id":"742","first_name":"John","last_name":"Donne","dob":"1572","dod":"1631"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox","sections":[{"id":"32165","section_number":"1","title":"Corona, La (The Cycle of 'The Crown')","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"416","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"32166","section_number":"2","title":"Holy Sonnets I to XIX (aka 'The Divine Meditations')","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1077","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"32167","section_number":"3","title":"Cross, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"254","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"32168","section_number":"4","title":"4 - Resurrection, Imperfect (or incomplete)","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"112","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"32169","section_number":"5","title":"Litany, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1054","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"63","name":"Single author"},{"id":"130","name":"Christianity - Other"}],"translators":[]}}}
