{"books":{"7":{"id":"9374","title":"Tolstoy","description":" Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) is universally regarded as one of the greatest authors in history. This brief biography discusses, among other things, Tolstoy's childhood, married life, contemporaries, travels, and his strongly held opinions concerning religion and class privilege. Individual chapters are devoted to War and Peace and Anna Karenina. The former, with its vivid character portrayals and great historical, political, and military insight, is considered by many to be the world's greatest novel. Another chapter is devoted to Tolstoy's other notable works, and the book concludes with a consideration of his lasting influence. <\/p>\n\nThe book, published in 1914, contains a bibliography listing works about and by Tolstoy. L. Winstanley was a lecturer in English at the University College at Wales. --Adapted by Lee Smalley","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/47353","language":"English","copyright_year":"1912","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9374","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/tolstoy_ls_1412_librivox\/tolstoy_ls_1412_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/tolstoy-by-l-winstanley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:12:51","totaltimesecs":11571,"authors":[{"id":"10983","first_name":"L.","last_name":"Winstanley","dob":"?","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/tolstoy_ls_1412_librivox","sections":[{"id":"324792","section_number":"1","title":"I","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_01_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1103","file_name":"tolstoy_01_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"324793","section_number":"2","title":"II","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_02_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1285","file_name":"tolstoy_02_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"324794","section_number":"3","title":"III","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_03_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1423","file_name":"tolstoy_03_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"324795","section_number":"4","title":"IV","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_04_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2011","file_name":"tolstoy_04_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"324796","section_number":"5","title":"V","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_05_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1926","file_name":"tolstoy_05_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"324797","section_number":"6","title":"VI","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_06_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1561","file_name":"tolstoy_06_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"324798","section_number":"7","title":"VII","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_07_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1614","file_name":"tolstoy_07_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]},{"id":"324799","section_number":"8","title":"VIII","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/tolstoy_08_winstanley_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"648","file_name":"tolstoy_08_winstanley_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee Smalley"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
