{"books":{"18":{"id":"3844","title":"Tale of Brownie Beaver","description":"Arthur Scott Bailey was the author of more than forty children's books, centered all his plots in the animal, bird and insect worlds, weaving natural history into the stories in a way that won educator's approval without arousing the suspicions of his young readers. The Tale of Brownie Beaver is another adventure of the friends and neighbours of Pleasant Valley. You will hear how Brownie keeps a house safe from a Freshet and how he receives his weekly newspaper and not to forget the making of a new suit.
