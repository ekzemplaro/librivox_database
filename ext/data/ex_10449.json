{"books":{"15":{"id":"10449","title":"On Loving God","description":"You want me to tell you why God is to be loved and how much.I answer, the reason for loving God is God Himself; and the measure of love due to Him is immeasurable love. . . .\"\n\nSaint Bernard's On Loving God is one of his most delightful, and most widely read, works. It stands in the tradition of the Fathers of the Church, but it carries patristic teaching into the Middle Ages and into the cloister. Its famous affirmation that God is to be loved without limit, sine modo, is taken directly from the letters of Saint Augustine. While the tract is not an example of scholastic theology, it shows a typically twelfth-century love of logic and an unexpectedly precise use of terminology. In reading or listening to this work, it is very important, as with all medieval authors, to take them on their own terms, without superimposing on them categories favored by later generations, even our own. Or especially not our own.(summary from wiki and the reader)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.ccel.org\/ccel\/bernard\/loving_god.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10449","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4221","first_name":" Saint","last_name":"Bernard of Clairvaux","dob":"1090","dod":"1153"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"357363","section_number":"0","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357364","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357365","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357366","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357367","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357368","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357369","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357370","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357371","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357372","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357373","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357374","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357375","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357376","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357377","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"357378","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"128","name":"Christianity - Commentary"}],"translators":[]}}}
