{"books":{"21":{"id":"7167","title":"Remodeled Farmhouses","description":"\"There is a certain fascination connected with the remodeling of a farmhouse. Its low, raftered interior, its weather-beaten exterior, never fail to appeal. Types vary with the period in which they were built, but all are of interest. In this collection, which has been pictured with great care, pains have been taken to show as many different types as possible, so that the student will be able to find numerous interesting details that can be incorporated into his contemplated remodeling.\" [opening lines of Preface] (Summary by Mary H.
