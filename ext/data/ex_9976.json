{"books":{"2":{"id":"9976","title":"Art of Money Getting (version 2)","description":"Although Barnum considered himself primarily a showman and his main goal was to put money in his own pocket, this little book, subtitled Golden Rules for Making Money does have a good deal of commonsense about how to make money, and perhaps more importantly, how to keep it once you've made it. Of course, having been written nearly a century and a half ago, some of the advice may be a little dated, but it remains a very readable self-help book. - Summary by Ruth Golding","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8581","language":"English","copyright_year":"1888","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9976","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1855","first_name":"P.
