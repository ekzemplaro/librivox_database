{"books":{"33":{"id":"9827","title":"Brewster's Millions (Version 2)","description":"Montgomery Brewster inherits a large sum of money. Then he learns he's to inherit 7 times as much! But there's a catch: he has to spend every penny of the first inheritance before his next birthday (in 357 days), and have no possessions or anything to show for it at the end of that month. If he succeeds, he'll be very wealthy; if he fails, he remains penniless. He finds that spending so much money is harder than he thinks! This book inspired several movies, including one starring Richard Pryor in 1985.  - Summary by
