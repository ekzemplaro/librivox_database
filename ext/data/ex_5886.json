{"books":{"13":{"id":"5886","title":"Yellow Journalist","description":"Rhoda Massey is a young, sharp reporter for a daily newspaper in San Francisco. After proving herself an astute and fearless investigator on her first big story, she spends most of her waking hours running down leads and doing (almost) anything it takes to produce headline grabbing tales and to be the first one to do so. She must compete with her male colleagues where she works but also with those from other newspapers. Rhoda discovers it useful to be pretty and small in stature (great for eavesdropping from tight and unusual locations) but it's her shrewd mind and her nose for news that propel her to pursue stories in dangerous places and, sometimes, from dangerous characters. Just how far is she prepared to go as a \u2018yellow\u2019 journalist who wants the truth and at what price to her integrity? Then there\u2019s the respected and handsome reporter, Ted Thompson, from a rival newspaper. Will he have a place in Rhoda\u2019s life?
