{"books":{"9":{"id":"3817","title":"Essays of Robert Louis Stevenson","description":"\u201cExtreme busyness\u2026is a symptom of deficient vitality; and a faculty for idleness implies a catholic appetite and a strong sense of personal identity.\u201d\n\nWhat comforting words for the idle among us! Like many of the best essayists, Stevenson is very much the genial fireside companion: opinionated, but never malicious; a marvellous practitioner of the inclusive monologue.\n\nIn this collection of nine pieces he discusses the art of appreciating unattractive scenery, traces the complex social life of dogs, and meditates in several essays upon the experience of reading literature and writing it. Perhaps his most personal passages concern death and mortality. Here we meet him at his most undogmatically optimistic, as he affirms a wholesome faith in \u201cthe liveableness of Life\u201d.\n(Summary by Martin Geeson)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/10761","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3817","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/essays_robert_louis_stevenson_mg_librivox\/essays_robert_louis_stevenson_mg_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/www.robert-louis-stevenson.org\/works","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/essays-of-robert-louis-stevenson-by-robert-louis-stevenson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:32:44","totaltimesecs":19964,"authors":[{"id":"115","first_name":"Robert Louis","last_name":"Stevenson","dob":"1850","dod":"1894"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/essays_robert_louis_stevenson_mg_librivox","sections":[{"id":"20885","section_number":"1","title":"01 - On the Enjoyment of Unpleasant Places","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1622","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20886","section_number":"2","title":"02 - An Apology for Idlers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2044","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20887","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Aes Triplex","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1885","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20888","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Talk and Talkers, part one","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2489","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20889","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Talk and Talkers, part two","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2104","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20890","section_number":"6","title":"06 - A Gossip on Romance","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2743","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20891","section_number":"7","title":"07 - The Character of Dogs","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2180","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20892","section_number":"8","title":"08 - A College Magazine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1920","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20893","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Books Which Have Influenced Me","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1463","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]},{"id":"20894","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Pulvis et Umbra","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1514","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3595","display_name":"Martin Geeson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"84","name":"Essays & Short Works"}],"translators":[]}}}
