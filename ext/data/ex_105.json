{"books":{"60":{"id":"105","title":"Wives and Daughters","description":"<p>If you like Jane Austen, you will probably like this book!<\/p><p>Mrs. Gaskell, as she was often referred to, is considered one of the greatest British novelists of the Victorian era. She was one of the earliest novelists ever to use dialect in her works, finding often that no word but the vernacular would suffice to convey the meaning she wanted to achieve. She was the author of The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, a much-acclaimed and sometimes-reviled biography of her friend and peer.<\/p><p>Wives and Daughters revolves around Molly Gibson, only daughter of a widowed doctor living in a provincial English town in the 1830s. The novel was first published in the Cornhill Magazine as a serial from August 1864 to January 1866. When Mrs Gaskell died suddenly in 1865, it was not quite complete, and the last section was written by Frederick Greenwood.
