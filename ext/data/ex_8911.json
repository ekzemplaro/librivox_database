His novels about boys who succeed under the tutelage of older mentors were hugely popular in their day.  This book, a true rags-to-riches novel, follows Grant, the oldest of three children that their mother, a widow is struggling to feed and clothe.  His determination to succeed is fierce and yet he never cheats or follows the easy path to success.   - Summary by Phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5833","language":"English","copyright_year":"1886","num_sections":"40","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8911","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"27","first_name":"Horatio","last_name":"Alger, Jr.","dob":"1832","dod":"1899"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"312225","section_number":"1","title":"THE MINISTER'S SON","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/helpinghimself_01_alger,jr.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9302","display_name":"Salma Yasser"}]},{"id":"312226","section_number":"2","title":"GRANT MAKES TWO BUSINESS CALLS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/helpinghimself_02_alger,jr.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9302","display_name":"Salma Yasser"}]},{"id":"312227","section_number":"3","title":"GRANT WALKS TO SOMERSET","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/helpinghimself_03_alger,jr.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9302","display_name":"Salma Yasser"}]},{"id":"312228","section_number":"4","title":"A TIMELY RESCUE","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9087","display_name":"TimoleonWash"}]},{"id":"312229","section_number":"5","title":"MRS.
