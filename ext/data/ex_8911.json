His novels about boys who succeed under the tutelage of older mentors were hugely popular in their day.  This book, a true rags-to-riches novel, follows Grant, the oldest of three children that their mother, a widow is struggling to feed and clothe.  His determination to succeed is fierce and yet he never cheats or follows the easy path to success.   - Summary by Phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5833","language":"English","copyright_year":"1886","num_sections":"40","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8911","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/helpinghimself_1410_librivox\/helpinghimself_1410_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/helping-himself-or-grant-thorntons-ambition-by-horatio-alger-jr-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"05:11:26","totaltimesecs":18686,"authors":[{"id":"27","first_name":"Horatio","last_name":"Alger, Jr.","dob":"1832","dod":"1899"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/helpinghimself_1410_librivox","sections":[{"id":"312225","section_number":"1","title":"THE MINISTER'S SON","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/helpinghimself_01_alger.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"502","file_name":"helpinghimself_01_alger_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"312226","section_number":"2","title":"GRANT MAKES TWO BUSINESS CALLS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/helpinghimself_02_alger.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"515","file_name":"helpinghimself_02_alger_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9393","display_name":"Ed Humpal"}]},{"id":"312227","section_number":"3","title":"GRANT WALKS TO SOMERSET","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/helpinghimself_03_alger,jr.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"578","file_name":"helpinghimself_03_alger_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9302","display_name":"Salma Yasser"}]},{"id":"312228","section_number":"4","title":"A TIMELY RESCUE","listen_url":"http:\/\/uploads.librivox.org\/philchenevert\/helpinghimself_04_alger,jr.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"475","file_name":"helpinghimself_04_alger_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9087","display_name":"TimoleonWash"}]},{"id":"312229","section_number":"5","title":"MRS.
