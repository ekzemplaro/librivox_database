{"books":{"19":{"id":"9634","title":"Sesame and Lilies","description":"John Ruskin\u2019s Sesame and Lilies (1865) consists of two lectures, \u201cOf Kings\u2019 Treasuries\u201d and \u201cOf Queens' Gardens,\u201d delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at Rusholme and Manchester. While these lectures emphasize the connections between nature, art and society, they are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. The first half of the original work, \u201cOf Kings\u2019 Treasuries,\u201d is a critique of Victorian manhood. The second half, \u201cOf Queens' Gardens,\u201d counsels women to be moral guides and urges parents to educate them as such. Although Sesame and Lilies was widely popular in its time, the work in its entirety has been out of print since the early twentieth century. A preface and a third essay, \u201cThe Mystery of Life and Its Arts,\u201d were added to later editions, first seen in 1871.\n\nFirst edition identification and notes: John Wiley and Son of New York first published Sesame and Lilies in 1865.
