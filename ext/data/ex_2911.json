Her debut as a story- and fairytale writer was in 1897, when she was 54 years old. She was a very productive and popular author around 1900 and in the early 20th Century. Alienation, lack of understanding, appreciation and sympathy, and the conflict between doing ones duty and freedom were often underlying themes of her stories. This collection of Fairy tales under the name \u201cJa och Nej\u201d (Yes and No) were published in the \u201cBarnbiliotket Saga\u201d (Children's Story Library) series in 1908 consisting of 8 Stories \/ Fairy tales and are a good example of her writings.
