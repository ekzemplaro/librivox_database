{"books":{"22":{"id":"3682","title":"Prester John","description":"<p>This classic adventure novel by the author of Greenmantle and The Thirty-Nine Steps relates the first-person exploits of young David Crawfurd before the age of twenty. \n<br\/><br\/>As a boy growing up on the coast of Scotland, minister's son Davie and two friends were pursued with murderous intent along the cliffs one night by John Laputa, a visiting black African preacher, whom they had witnessed performing un-Christian rites round a campfire on the beach. A few years later, when his father's death forces Davie to quit college and join the tribe of wandering Scots, our hero finds himself in South Africa, assistant shopkeeper in a seemingly sleepy back-veldt store. There he re-encounters Laputa, now charismatic leader of an incipient native uprising, secretly preaching the incendiary creed of \"Africa for the Africans,\" and proclaiming himself heir to the mantle of Prester John, a legendary 15th-century Christian king of Ethiopia.<br\/><br\/>\n\nCan young Davie possibly penetrate the megalomaniac's mountain stronghold, foil the insurrection, prevent a massacre of white settlers, and make off with the rebels' war-chest of gold and diamonds? It's going to take some doing - and not a little derring-do! <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/presterjohn00buch","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3682","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/prester_john_gh_librivox\/prester_john_gh_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/prester-john-by-john-buchan\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:44:54","totaltimesecs":27894,"authors":[{"id":"83","first_name":"John","last_name":"Buchan","dob":"1875","dod":"1940"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/prester_john_gh_librivox","sections":[{"id":"17467","section_number":"1","title":"I - The Man on the Kirkcaple Shore","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1590","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4191","display_name":"Grant Hurlock"}]},{"id":"17468","section_number":"2","title":"II - Furth!
