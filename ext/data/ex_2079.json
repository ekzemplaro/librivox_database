{"books":{"19":{"id":"2079","title":"Varied Types","description":"<p>Another delightful and sharply pointed excursion into the topics of the day, and of our day as well, with Gilbert Keith Chesterton. Here he uses his wit and mastery of paradox to bring into focus a number of historical persons who in many ways typify the people who presently shape our world and who in their own right have already shaped Western civilization. These reprinted magazine articles are filled with his good-natured wit and devastating ability to use <i>reductio ad absurdum<\/i> to destroy the popular myths that drive our society at full-speed into, and expose the utter nonsense that underlies, secular humanism. You will come away with yet another new collection of wonderful quotes.\n(Summary by Ray Clare)<\/p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/14203","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2079","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/varied_types_rd_librivox1\/varied_types_rd_librivox1_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/varied-types-by-g-k-chesterton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:45:48","totaltimesecs":17148,"authors":[{"id":"426","first_name":"G.
