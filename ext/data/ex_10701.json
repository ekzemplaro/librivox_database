{"books":{"12":{"id":"10701","title":"Warwickshire Lad: The Story of the Boyhood of William Shakespeare","description":"*AS ALWAYS, THIS IS A TEMPORARY SUMMARY TO GET YOU TO READ THIS BOOK :wink: *\nEver wonder what happened to ol' Billy Shakespeare as a child? How did Little Will get to be the great writer that we remember him for? This cute little coming of age story charts Willy's life from the age of 5 into his early adulthood. And, as I haven't fully read it yet, just skimmed through in the search of something quaint to BC, so I'm really looking forward to DPLing this! It may be nice to get it done before his Death Date celebrations, but no pressure and no worries if it isn't. Chapters are nice and short, so suitable for the newbies, drama people like me who hate proper narrating and those with experience looking for something lighter!","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/27187","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10701","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11862","first_name":"George Madden","last_name":"Martin","dob":"1866","dod":"1946"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"364347","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7510","display_name":"Kathrine Engan"}]},{"id":"364348","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364349","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364350","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364351","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364352","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364353","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364354","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364355","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364356","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364357","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364358","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"364359","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"42","name":"Historical"}],"translators":[]}}}
