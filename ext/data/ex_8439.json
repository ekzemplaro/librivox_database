{"books":{"22":{"id":"8439","title":"Now It Can Be Told","description":"In this book I have written about some aspects of the war which, I\nbelieve, the world must know and remember, not only as a memorial of\nmen's courage in tragic years, but as a warning of what will happen\nagain--surely--if a heritage of evil and of folly is not cut out of the\nhearts of peoples. Here it is the reality of modern warfare not only as\nit appears to British soldiers, of whom I can tell, but to soldiers on\nall the fronts where conditions were the same...<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe purpose of this book is to get deeper into the truth of this war and\nof all war--not by a more detailed narrative of events, but rather as\nthe truth was revealed to the minds of men, in many aspects, out\nof their experience; and by a plain statement of realities, however\npainful, to add something to the world's knowledge out of which men of\ngood-will may try to shape some new system of relationship between one\npeople and another, some new code of international morality, preventing\nor at least postponing another massacre of youth like that five years'\nsacrifice of boys of which I was a witness.<br \/>\n - Summary by Philip Gibbs, from the Preface","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/3317","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8439","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/nowitcanbetold_1406_librivox\/nowitcanbetold_1406_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/now-it-can-be-told-by-philip-gibbs\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"19:00:34","totaltimesecs":68434,"authors":[{"id":"10253","first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Gibbs","dob":"1877","dod":"1962"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/nowitcanbetold_1406_librivox","sections":[{"id":"300076","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1: Observers and Commanders, Preface and Chapters 1 to 5","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/nowitcanbetold_01_gibbs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2259","file_name":"nowitcanbetold_01_gibbs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8753","display_name":"Walt Allan"}]},{"id":"300077","section_number":"2","title":"Part 1: Chapters 6 to 14","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/nowitcanbetold_02_gibbs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2482","file_name":"nowitcanbetold_02_gibbs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8753","display_name":"Walt Allan"}]},{"id":"300078","section_number":"3","title":"Part 1: Chapters 15 to 21","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/nowitcanbetold_03_gibbs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2891","file_name":"nowitcanbetold_03_gibbs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8753","display_name":"Walt Allan"}]},{"id":"300079","section_number":"4","title":"Part 2: The School of Courage.
