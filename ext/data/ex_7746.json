{"books":{"23":{"id":"7746","title":"Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson","description":"Billed as a satire concerning the dishonest advertising and business practices of the day, it tells the tale of an upstart clothing business doomed from the get-go to utter failure. Its \nsenior partner (the elderly Brown, who provides the investment) is far too timid for business. His son-in-law (Jones, who runs the store) is stealing from the till, and the junior partner, \nRobinson (who writes advertisements for the store) is so obsessed with the idea that advertising alone will drive the business, he uses up every last penny of the capital investment \nin a series of increasingly ludicrous ad campaigns and publicity stunts.\n\nThrown into this mix are the two daughters of Brown, who are equally cold and calculating. The elder (married to Jones) is constantly trying to wring money out of the old man, and \nthe younger, Maryanne, spends the entire novel playing off of two potential suitors, Robinson, or Brisket the butcher (one of Trollope's wonderful examples of ironic character \nnaming). (above summary by Steve Forsyth, Texas) \n\nNevertheless, Trollope shows considerable sympathy for the risks faced by small businessmen (and also notes the vulnerability of writers to over-ready critics); Robinson is to publish his experiences in the Cornhill Magazine, a prominent journal for over 100 years, in which many Victorians serialized novels (including this one). In the final chapter there is a surprising ennoblement of Robinson, and a very positive ending (final comments by Arnold Banner)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/27533","language":"English","copyright_year":"1862","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7746","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/brown_jones_robinson_ab_librivox\/brown_jones_robinson_ab_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-struggles-of-brown-jones-and-robinson-by-anthony-trollope\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:07:48","totaltimesecs":29268,"authors":[{"id":"513","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Trollope","dob":"1815","dod":"1882"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/brown_jones_robinson_ab_librivox","sections":[{"id":"118908","section_number":"1","title":"Preface.
