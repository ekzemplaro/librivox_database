{"books":{"19":{"id":"10577","title":"Chore Time","description":"Jean McKishnie Blewett (4 November 1862 \u2013 19 August 1934) was a Canadian journalist, author and poet.\n\nBlewett was a regular contributor to The Globe, a Toronto newspaper and in 1898 became editor of its Homemakers Department. In 1919, assisted by the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, she published a booklet titled Heart Stories to benefit war charities. During this time she regularly lectured on topics such as temperance and suffragism. She used the pseudonym Katherine Kent for some of her writing.\n\nAfter her death, fellow female journalist Bride Broder wrote in tribute:\n\nThere is a simplicity about Mrs. Blewett's prose and verse that has made a wide appeal, and her gay-hearted attitude to life, the humorous twists she gave to little things, made her very welcome as a speaker at women's gatherings. In all her writings she touched on the things that appeal to women everywhere and, in doing so, won the admiration of men readers also.
