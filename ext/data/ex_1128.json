{"books":{"22":{"id":"1128","title":"Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson","description":"In one of his later novels, the master storyteller spins a tale of two children switched at infancy. A slave takes on the identity of master and heir while the rightful heir is condemned to live the life of a slave. Twain uses this vehicle to explore themes of nature vs. nurture, racial bigotry and moral relativism. The case of mistaken identity is a theme that Twain explored also in THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER; in THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD'NHEAD WILSON he turns the theme into a well-crafted detective story. It is unfortunate that this is one of Twain's lesser known works as it is one of his most enjoyable reads.<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/102","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1128","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/puddnhead_my_librivox\/puddnhead_my_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pudd'nhead_Wilson","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-tragedy-of-puddnhead-wilson-by-mark-twain\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:06:37","totaltimesecs":25597,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/puddnhead_my_librivox","sections":[{"id":"139382","section_number":"1","title":"Pudd'nhead
