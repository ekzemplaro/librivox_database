{"books":{"13":{"id":"9307","title":"Chronicles of Canada Volume 28 - The Fathers of Confederation: A Chronicle of the Birth of the Dominion","description":" During and after the United States' War of Independence, Canada remained loyal to Great Britain. The upheavals of the 1830's and early 1840's led to a Popular Government and union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1841, but many still wanted confederation.
