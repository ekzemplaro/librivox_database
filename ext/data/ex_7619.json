{"books":{"15":{"id":"7619","title":"Adventures of Bindle","description":"Jenkins' most popular fictional creation was Mr. Joseph Bindle, who first appeared in a humorous novel in 1916 and in a number of sequels. In the preface to the books, T. P. O'Connor said that \"Bindle is the greatest Cockney that has come into being through the medium of literature since Dickens wrote Pickwick Papers\". The stories are based on the comedic drama of life at work, at home and all the adventures that take place along the way.
