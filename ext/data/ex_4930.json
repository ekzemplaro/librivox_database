{"books":{"10":{"id":"4930","title":"Pursuit of God","description":"\"As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\" This thirst for an intimate relationship with God, claims A.W. Tozer, is not for a select few, but should be the experience of every follower of Christ. But, he asserts, it is all too rare when believers have become conditioned by tradition to accept standards of mediocrity, and the church struggles with formality and worldliness. Using examples from Scripture and from the lives of saints who lived with this thirst for God, Tozer sheds light on the path to a closer walk with God. (Summary by D. Leeson)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/25141","language":"English","copyright_year":"1957","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4930","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/pursuit_of_god_1105_librivox\/pursuit_of_god_1105_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-pursuit-of-god-by-aiden-wilson-tozer\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:53:24","totaltimesecs":10404,"authors":[{"id":"2033","first_name":"Aiden Wilson","last_name":"Tozer","dob":"1897","dod":"1963"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/pursuit_of_god_1105_librivox","sections":[{"id":"51693","section_number":"0","title":"00 - \tIntroduction\/Preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"490","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51694","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Following Hard After God","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"916","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51695","section_number":"2","title":"02 - \tThe Blessedness of Possessing Nothing","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"946","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51696","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Removing the Veil","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1371","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51697","section_number":"4","title":"04 - \tApprehending God","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"927","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51698","section_number":"5","title":"05 - \t\tThe Universal Presence","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1020","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51699","section_number":"6","title":"06 - The Speaking Voice","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"915","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51700","section_number":"7","title":"07 - \tThe Gaze of the Soul","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1172","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51701","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Restoring the Creator-Creature Relation","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"926","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51702","section_number":"9","title":"09 - \tMeekness and Rest","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"705","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]},{"id":"51703","section_number":"10","title":"10 - The Sacrament of Living","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1016","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2827","display_name":"David Leeson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"102","name":"Religion"}],"translators":[]}}}
