{"books":{"20":{"id":"7671","title":"Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies","description":"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (Spanish: Brev\u00edsima relaci\u00f3n de la destrucci\u00f3n de las Indias) is an account written by the Spanish Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas in 1542 (published in 1552) about the mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas in colonial times and sent to then Prince Philip II of Spain. One of the stated purposes for writing the account is his fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and his concern for the souls of the Native Peoples. The account is one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict examples of unfair treatment that indigenous people endured in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola.[citation needed] Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he describes, have inflicted a great loss on the indigenous occupants of the islands.
