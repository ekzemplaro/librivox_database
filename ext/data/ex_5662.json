{"books":{"16":{"id":"5662","title":"Trent's Last Case (Version 2)","description":"This is one of a series of EC Bentley novels featuring the highly erudite artist qua reporter \/ detective, Philip Trent.<br\/><br\/>\n\nIn it, Trent is sent to a charming English seaside village to cover the murder of Sigsbee Manderson for a large London newspaper. The victim is an unpopular and extremely powerful financial tycoon, who is murdered virtually within sight of his own house, at a time when it seems impossible that anyone there \u2013 to say nothing of all of its more than half dozen inhabitants \u2013 could have failed to see or hear the crime being committed.<br\/><br\/>\n\nAs Trent pokes around, attention is focused on Manderson\u2019s extremely troubled marriage, not least because Trent himself falls in love with Margaret Manderson, the widow of the murdered man. At the same time, Trent himself considers her to be at least complicit in the crime for much of the novel. The plot cannot be described further without spoiling the punch-line, as it were. Indeed, to the really clever detective fiction-lover, this is already almost saying too much.<br\/><br\/>\n\nTrent\u2019s Last Case was on the \u201cten best\u201d list of Rex Stout, author of the famous Nero Wolfe mysteries. Like Stout, Bentley has a fondness for complex plot twists of the \u201cboxes within boxes\u201d variety.\n\n(Introduction by Kirsten Wever)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/21854","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5662","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/trents_last_case_kw_librivox\/trents_last_case_kw_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/trents-last-case-version-2-by-edmund-clerihew-bentley\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:43:23","totaltimesecs":27803,"authors":[{"id":"713","first_name":"Edmund Clerihew","last_name":"Bentley","dob":"1875","dod":"1956"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/trents_last_case_kw_librivox","sections":[{"id":"70646","section_number":"0","title":"Prologue","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1097","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70647","section_number":"1","title":"Knocking The Town Endways","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"957","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70648","section_number":"2","title":"Breakfast","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2054","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70649","section_number":"3","title":"Handcuffs in the Air","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3695","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70650","section_number":"4","title":"Poking About","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1744","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70651","section_number":"5","title":"Mr. Bunner on the Case","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1099","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70652","section_number":"6","title":"The Lady in Black","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1495","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70653","section_number":"7","title":"The Inquest","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"726","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70654","section_number":"8","title":"A Hot Scent","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"788","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70655","section_number":"9","title":"The Wife of Dives","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1265","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70656","section_number":"10","title":"\"Hitherto Unpublished\"","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2359","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70657","section_number":"11","title":"Evil Days","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1199","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70658","section_number":"12","title":"Eruption","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2572","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70659","section_number":"13","title":"Writing A Letter","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"470","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70660","section_number":"14","title":"Double Cunning Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2556","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70661","section_number":"15","title":"Double Cunning Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1966","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"70662","section_number":"16","title":"The Last Straw","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1761","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"22","name":"Detective Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
