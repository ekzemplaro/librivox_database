{"books":{"10":{"id":"10632","title":"Purity of Heart: Letters by General Booth to Salvationists and Others","description":"This book, first published in 1902, brings together ten letters written by William Booth, founder and first General of The Salvation Army.  Booth initially wrote these letters with the intention that they be read aloud as a ten-week sermon series on the subject of purity of heart.  Each letter focuses on a different aspect of holiness, such as reasons that a pure heart is desirable, the way to become holy, and examples of people whose hearts have been purified.  In accordance with their initial purpose, the letters have many of the qualities typical of Salvation Army sermons; many of the letters begin with a summary of the previous week's message, include frequent appeals to quoted hymn lyrics throughout, and conclude with an altar call.  Although the letters together form what could be considered a Salvationist theology of holiness, this book is less a theological treatise than an impassioned call to holiness by a vibrant preacher who eagerly wishes to cast aside any obstacles his hearers may encounter in seeking it, whether those obstacles be misunderstandings, false beliefs, reasoned objections, or insufficient desire. - Summary by David Purdy","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/purityofheartlet00boot","language":"English","copyright_year":"1902","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10632","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11818","first_name":"William","last_name":"Booth","dob":"1829","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"362382","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362383","section_number":"1","title":"Purity: What It Is","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362384","section_number":"2","title":"Purity Commanded","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362385","section_number":"3","title":"Purity Means Deliverance","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362386","section_number":"4","title":"Purity Described","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362387","section_number":"5","title":"Purity and Love","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362388","section_number":"6","title":"Purity Possible","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362389","section_number":"7","title":"Purity, God's Gift","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362390","section_number":"8","title":"Purifying Faith","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362391","section_number":"9","title":"Witnesses","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]},{"id":"362568","section_number":"10","title":"How to Keep Pure","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10542","display_name":"David Purdy"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"128","name":"Christianity - Commentary"}],"translators":[]}}}
