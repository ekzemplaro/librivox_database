{"books":{"8":{"id":"10766","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor","description":"Aline Murray Kilmer (August 1, 1888 \u2013 October 1, 1941), was an American poet, children's book author, and essayist, and the wife and widow of poet and journalist Joyce Kilmer (1886-1918).\n\nAline attended the Rutgers College Preparatory School with her husband, Alfred Joyce Kilmer and married him soon after his graduation from Columbia University in 1908. In their short marriage, lasting 10 years, her husband had achieved fame as a poet, literary critic and among Catholic circles as America's most prominent Catholic writer. After his death in World War I, Aline began publishing her own poetry and a few children's books. Today, her work is largely forgotten. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/books\/kilmer\/kilmer05.html#sisters","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10766","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/two_little_sisters_of_the_poor_1604.poem_librivox\/two_little_sisters_of_the_poor_1604.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:09:06","totaltimesecs":546,"authors":[{"id":"9388","first_name":"Aline","last_name":"Kilmer","dob":"1888","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/two_little_sisters_of_the_poor_1604.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"366627","section_number":"1","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"75","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"366621","section_number":"2","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by BMH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_bmh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"50","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_bmh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10686","display_name":"Bridget Herbes"}]},{"id":"366620","section_number":"3","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"64","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"366624","section_number":"4","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by EBA","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_ebs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_ebs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8886","display_name":"Esther ben Simonides"}]},{"id":"366622","section_number":"5","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"59","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_lah_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"366625","section_number":"6","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"62","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"366628","section_number":"7","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by SMR","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_smr_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_smr_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10154","display_name":"shevyon4HIM"}]},{"id":"366623","section_number":"8","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by T","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_t_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"56","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_t_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10615","display_name":"Twinkle"}]},{"id":"366626","section_number":"9","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by TYB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_tyb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"50","file_name":"sisters_kilmer_tyb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9092","display_name":"Teresa Bauman"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
