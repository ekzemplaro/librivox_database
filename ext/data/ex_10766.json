In their short marriage, lasting 10 years, her husband had achieved fame as a poet, literary critic and among Catholic circles as America's most prominent Catholic writer. After his death in World War I, Aline began publishing her own poetry and a few children's books. Today, her work is largely forgotten. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/books\/kilmer\/kilmer05.html#sisters","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10766","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"9388","first_name":"Aline","last_name":"Kilmer","dob":"1888","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"366621","section_number":"1","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by BMH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_bmh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10686","display_name":"Bridget Herbes"}]},{"id":"366620","section_number":"2","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"366624","section_number":"3","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by EBA","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_ebs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8886","display_name":"Esther ben Simonides"}]},{"id":"366622","section_number":"4","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"366625","section_number":"5","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"366623","section_number":"6","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by T","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_t_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10615","display_name":"Twinkle"}]},{"id":"366626","section_number":"7","title":"To Two Little Sisters of the Poor - Read by TYB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sisters_kilmer_tyb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9092","display_name":"Teresa Bauman"}]},{"id":"366627","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366628","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366629","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366630","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366631","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366632","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366633","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366634","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366635","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366636","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366637","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366638","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"366639","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
