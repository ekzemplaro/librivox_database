{"books":{"9":{"id":"7046","title":"Autobiography of St. Ignatius","description":"This account of the life of St. Ignatius, dictated by himself to Father Gonzalez, is a most valuable record of the great Founder of the  Society of Jesus. It, more than any other work, gives an insight into the spiritual life of St. Ignatius. Few works in ascetical literature, except the writings of St. Teresa and St. Augustine, impart such a knowledge of the soul.The saint in his narrative always refers to himself in the third person, and this mode of speech has here been retained. Many persons who have neither the time, nor, perhaps, the inclination, to read larger works, will read, we trust, with pleasure and profit this autobiography.   Ignatius, as he lay wounded in his brother's house, read the lives of the saints to while away the time. Touched by grace, he cried, \"What St. Francis and St. Dominic have done, that, by God's grace, I will do.\" May this little book, in like manner, inspire its readers with the desire of imitating St. Ignatius. This autobiography is a valuable key for the understanding of his Spiritual Exercises. It was kept in the archives for about 150 years (Summary from the preface)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/24534","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7046","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/autobiography_ignatiusloyola_pc_librivox\/autobiography_ignatiusloyola_pc_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-autobiography-of-st-ignatius-by-st-ignatius-loyola\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:13:55","totaltimesecs":8035,"authors":[{"id":"3326","first_name":"St. Ignatius","last_name":"Loyola","dob":"1491","dod":"1556"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/autobiography_ignatiusloyola_pc_librivox","sections":[{"id":"106630","section_number":"0","title":"0 - Preface of the Writer","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_0_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"459","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106631","section_number":"1","title":"1- Chapter I - His Military Life; He is Wounded; His Cure;Spiritual Reading\u2014The Apparition\u2014The Gift of Chastity\u2014His Longing for the Journey to Jerusalem and for a Holier Life","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_1_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"593","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106632","section_number":"2","title":"2 - Chapter II - Ignatius Leaves His Native Land; What he did at Montserrat and Manresa","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_2_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"977","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106633","section_number":"3","title":"3 - Chapter III Scruples\u2014Heavenly Favors\u2014Journey to Barcelona","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_3_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1070","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106634","section_number":"4","title":"4 - Chapter IV His Journey to Rome, Venice, Jerusalem, and the Holy Land","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_4_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"644","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106635","section_number":"5","title":"5 - Chapter V He is apprehended as a Spy\u2014He is despised as a Fool\u2014His Studies at Barcelona and Alcala","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_5_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"828","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106636","section_number":"6","title":"6 - Chapter VI The Prisons at Alcala and Salamanca","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_6_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"943","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106637","section_number":"7","title":"7 - Chapter VII His Studies in Paris, and Other Incidents of his Life","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_7_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1008","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106638","section_number":"8","title":"8 - Chapter VIII His Journey into Spain and Italy\u2014The Famous Apparition and his Life in the Same Place","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_8_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"843","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"106639","section_number":"9","title":"9 - Appendix: St. Ignatius and his Work for Education","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/autobiographyofstignatius_9_loyola.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"670","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"},{"id":"102","name":"Religion"}],"translators":[]}}}
