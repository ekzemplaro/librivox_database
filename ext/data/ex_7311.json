{"books":{"15":{"id":"7311","title":"Wonders of the Jungle","description":"How do elephants drink? What is the Law of the Jungle at the water hole? How does an elephant baby learn to feed and learn to swim? How do they walk under water? In what order do buffaloes drink? How do buffaloes fight the tiger? These and other wild inhabitants of the Indian jungle such as pigs, wild dogs, deer, camels, bears and birds are discussed in lively stories to entertain but mainly educate children of school age. \"One of the great thinkers of the world has said that all the sciences are embodied in natural history. Hence natural history should be taught to a child from an early age. Perhaps the best method of teaching it is to set forth the characteristics of animals in the form of a narrative. Then the child reads the narrative with pleasure and almost as a story, not as a tedious \"lesson.\" In this book the animals are described in their daily life, and the main scientific facts and principles concerning each animal are woven into the narrative as a part of that daily life.\" (Summary by Phil Chenevert and from the Preface) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/24852","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7311","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/wondersofthejungle_1304_librivox\/wondersofthejungle_1304_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-wonders-of-the-jungle-by-sarath-kumar-ghosh\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:33:36","totaltimesecs":12816,"authors":[{"id":"6144","first_name":" Sarath Kumar","last_name":"Ghosh","dob":"1883","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/wondersofthejungle_1304_librivox","sections":[{"id":"111902","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The Midnight Pool","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"773","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7848","display_name":"bala"}]},{"id":"111903","section_number":"2","title":"02 - \tThe Law of the Jungle","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"752","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7906","display_name":"Alexandra Bogensperger"}]},{"id":"111904","section_number":"3","title":"03 - \tThe Elephants' Bath","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"527","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7947","display_name":"CopperWhiteLatte"}]},{"id":"111905","section_number":"4","title":"04 - \tElephants: The Tricks of the Jungle","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1213","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5038","display_name":"John Kooz"}]},{"id":"111906","section_number":"5","title":"05 - \tElephants: The Tricky Trap","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1033","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5038","display_name":"John Kooz"}]},{"id":"111907","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Buffaloes: The Knights of the Jungle","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1228","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7879","display_name":"deongines"}]},{"id":"111908","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Taming the Buffalo","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"519","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7879","display_name":"deongines"}]},{"id":"111909","section_number":"8","title":"08 - \tThe Buffalo and the Boy","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"839","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7879","display_name":"deongines"}]},{"id":"111910","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Deer and Antelope","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"894","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7848","display_name":"bala"}]},{"id":"111911","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Deer and Antelope: Their Special Gifts","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"937","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5019","display_name":"Sandra Estenson"}]},{"id":"111912","section_number":"11","title":"11 - \tThe Camel","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1164","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7848","display_name":"bala"}]},{"id":"111913","section_number":"12","title":"12 - \tThe Camel and the Thief","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"574","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7946","display_name":"Flash"}]},{"id":"111914","section_number":"13","title":"13 - \tBears","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"945","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8142","display_name":"Timothy Lucas"}]},{"id":"111915","section_number":"14","title":"14 - \tBears: The Tricky Trap","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"297","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7968","display_name":"TheRisenfreak"}]},{"id":"111916","section_number":"15","title":"15 - \tBright Birds","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"842","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6788","display_name":"Pamela Krantz"}]},{"id":"111917","section_number":"16","title":"16 - The Caged Parrot","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"279","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6788","display_name":"Pamela Krantz"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"77","name":"Animals"}],"translators":[]}}}
