{"books":{"135":{"id":"10538","title":"Poems of Jonathan Swift, Volume Two","description":"<br \/>\nHe lived simply, loved his walks and craved the company of fellow poetical wits as they craved his company in return. With his pal Dr. Sheridan, for one, Jonathan Swift delighted in the 18th century equivalent of a rap off \u2013 going back and forth in dueling verse repartee. This second volume is a cornucopia of biting, iconoclastic humor and earnest criticism of injustice. Poems herein concerning Wood\u2019s Halfpence are the companion to his famous Drapier\u2019s Letters and trumpet his achievement in stirring up sufficient outcry to spare Ireland from damaging monetary debasement. He knew what real money was: \u201cFor in all the leases that ever we hold We must pay our rent in good silver and gold, And not in brass tokens of such a base mould.\u201d And he didn\u2019t think much of monetary debasement\u2019s evil twin, fractional reserve banking, either: \u201cWe want our money on the nail The Banker\u2019s ruin\u2019d if he pays\u201d. There\u2019s a healthy smattering here of bums and urination references too \u2013 just so you know these are genuine Swift poems -- and all manner of other topics too. In Death and Daphne, written for a favorite grisette, we learn of Death\u2019s sagging libido due to the skinniness of his human bride. And the last poem excoriating Sheridan for comparing base women to noble clouds is a heavenly coup de gr\u00e2ce for any challenger who would dare to top his politically incorrect and thunderous wit:\n<br \/>Some critic may object, perhaps,\n<br \/>That clouds are blamed for giving claps;\n<br \/>But what, alas! are claps ethereal,\n<br \/>Compared for mischief to venereal?<br \/> - Summary
