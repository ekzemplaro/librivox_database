{"books":{"23":{"id":"5827","title":"Wonderful Wizard of Oz (version 2, solo)","description":"The story chronicles the adventures of a girl named Dorothy Gale in the Land of Oz. As Baum says in the introduction \"It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\" And it succeeds wonderfully. It is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture and has been widely translated. This is the first of thirteen more Oz books.
