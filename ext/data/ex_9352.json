He was attracted to enlightenment and to medieval Hebrew poetry. Feierberg was one of the announcers of symbolism in the Hebrew literature. He published short stories in the Hebrew newspapers, but his main work was the novel \u201cWhither?\u201d that was published shortly after his death. It follows the vacillations of a young man concerning faith, enlightenment, people and destiny. His answer to the question \u201cwhither?\u201d was the land of Israel. This work became central to Zionist thought.  Feierberg died young of tuberculosis.
