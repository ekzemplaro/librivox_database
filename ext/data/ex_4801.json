{"books":{"7":{"id":"4801","title":"Great God Pan","description":"<p>\"The Great God Pan\" is a novella written by Arthur Machen. A version of the story was published in the magazine Whirlwind in 1890, and Machen revised and extended it for its book publication (together with another story, \"The Inmost Light\") in 1894. On publication it was widely denounced by the press as degenerate and horrific because of its decadent style and sexual content, although it has since garnered a reputation as a classic of horror. Machen\u2019s story was only one of many at the time to focus on Pan as a useful symbol for the power of nature and paganism. The title was taken from the poem \"A Musical Instrument\" published in 1862 by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in which the first line of every stanza ends \"... the great god Pan.\"\n(via Wikipedia)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/389","language":"English","copyright_year":"1890","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4801","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/great_god_pan_1108_librivox\/great_god_pan_1108_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Great_God_Pan","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-great-god-pan-by-arthur-machen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:59:35","totaltimesecs":7175,"authors":[{"id":"2155","first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"Machen","dob":"1863","dod":"1947"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/great_god_pan_1108_librivox","sections":[{"id":"48166","section_number":"1","title":"The Experiment","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1068","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]},{"id":"48167","section_number":"2","title":"Mr. Clarke's Memoirs","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"909","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]},{"id":"48168","section_number":"3","title":"The City of Resurrections","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"988","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]},{"id":"48169","section_number":"4","title":"The Discovery in Paul Street","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"767","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]},{"id":"48170","section_number":"5","title":"The Letter of Advice","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"707","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]},{"id":"48171","section_number":"6","title":"The Suicides","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1064","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]},{"id":"48172","section_number":"7","title":"The Encounter in Soho","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"880","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]},{"id":"48173","section_number":"8","title":"The Fragments","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"792","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4193","display_name":"Ethan Rampton"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"16","name":"Horror & Supernatural Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
