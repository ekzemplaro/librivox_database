{"books":{"36":{"id":"10223","title":"Symbolism","description":"Johann Adam M\u00f6hler was professor theology at the T\u00fcbingen University where both Catholics and Protestants taught and studied. In 1832 he published Symbolism; a work that examined the doctrines of original sin, grace and free will as held by the different Christian confessions. It caused a storm of controversy in the Protestant nations of Europe. In it he turned the weapons furnished by Hegel, the \u201cProtestant Aquinas\u201d, against Protestantism. His method and style were supported by the use of facts, texts, and documents. By 1838 Symbolism had been translated to 8 languages and its author had died before he completed its 5th edition. <br><br>In an age when the Catholic Church found itself divided into two camps, the \u201cGerman\u201d and the \u201cRoman\u201d, D\u00f6llinger, a former pupil of M\u00f6hler\u2019s, when addressing a group of scholars at Munich in 1863 once famously quipped that the former were defending Catholicism with rifles while the latter were still using bows and arrows. The \u201cRomans\u201d, however, would succeed in silencing thier \u201cGerman\u201d brethren at the First Vatican Council and cut off a branch bearing good fruit. A rediscovery of the \u201cGerman\u201d school is long overdue and there is no better place to start than M\u00f6hler\u2019s Symbolism.
