{"books":{"1":{"id":"5014","title":"Asteroid of Fear","description":"John Endlich needed to clean up his act. Gambling, drinking, a hot temper and wanderlust were the last things Rose and the kids needed. So he went to the Homesteaders Office and signed up to terraform Vesta, a chunk of a once thriving alien planet that had exploded from within; a flat lump of crust which was now the remains of a farm on one side and a mining operation on the other. The miners hated Endlich and sabotaged his plans at every opportunity. They were going to kill him and his family if he didn\u2019t find a way to stop them. - Asteroid of Fear was first published in the March, 1951 edition of Planet Stories magazine.
