{"books":{"82":{"id":"5588","title":"Round the Block","description":"In Round the Block (1864), John Bell Bouton, a newspaper editor who later became a travel writer, stirs together comedy and pathos to explore the schemes and dreams of the average and extraordinary people inhabiting and intermingling on a single New York City block. In the path of the novel's circumambulation lie mystery, romance, and a murder trial, as love-matches and fortunes are made and lost through invention, speculation, and flimflam - plenty of flimflam. This richly-charactered novel, told with Dickensian brio, offers a fascinating slice of life, vivid in detail, of the bustling big-city habits and mores of America shortly before the Civil War.

Hurlock)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/12243","language":"English","copyright_year":"1864","num_sections":"83","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5588","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/roundtheblock_gh_librivox\/roundtheblock_gh_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/round-the-block-by-john-bell-bouton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"18:06:52","totaltimesecs":65212,"authors":[{"id":"2383","first_name":"John
