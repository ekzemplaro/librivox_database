{"books":{"12":{"id":"6853","title":"Zanzibar Tales","description":"If you have read any accounts of adventure in Africa, you will know that travelers never mention animals of any kind that are gifted with the faculty of speech, or gazelles that are overseers for native princes, or hares that eat flesh. No, indeed; only the native-born know of these; and, judging by the immense and rapid strides civilization is making in those parts, it will not be long before such wonderful specimens of zo\u00f6logy will be as extinct as the ichthyosaurus, dinornis, and other poor creatures who never dreamed of the awful names that would be applied to them when they were too long dead to show their resentment. As to the truth of these tales, I can only say that they were told to me, in Zanzibar, by negroes whose ancestors told them to them, who had received them from their ancestors, and so back; so that the praise for their accuracy, or the blame for their falsity, lies with the first ancestor who set them going. <br>\n\nYou may think uncivilized negroes are pretty ignorant people, but the white man who is supposed to have first told the story of \u201cThe House that Jack Built\u201d was a mighty poor genius compared with the unknown originator of \u201cGoso, the Teacher,\u201d who found even inanimate things that were endowed with speech, which the pupils readily understood and were not astonished to hear; while \u201cPuss in Boots\u201d was not one-half so clever as the gazelle that ran things for Haamdaanee. It would be a severe task to rattle off \u201cGoso\u201d as you do \u201cThe House that Jack Built.\u201d (Summary by the author) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/37472","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6853","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/zanzibar_tales_1209_librivox\/zanzibar_tales_1209_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/zanzibar-tales-by-george-w-bateman\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:41:19","totaltimesecs":9679,"authors":[{"id":"3318","first_name":"George W.","last_name":"Bateman","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/zanzibar_tales_1209_librivox","sections":[{"id":"101830","section_number":"0","title":"00 To My Readers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"271","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"101831","section_number":"1","title":"01 The Monkey, the Shark, and the Washerman\u2019s Donkey","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"529","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7511","display_name":"Sherri Vance"}]},{"id":"101832","section_number":"2","title":"02 The Hare and the Lion","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"610","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7594","display_name":"Kristel Tretter"}]},{"id":"101833","section_number":"3","title":"03 The Lion, the Hyena, and the Rabbit","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"348","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]},{"id":"101834","section_number":"4","title":"04 The Kites and the Crows","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"420","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]},{"id":"101835","section_number":"5","title":"05 Goso, the Teacher","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"447","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7606","display_name":"Venita"}]},{"id":"101836","section_number":"6","title":"06 The Ape, the Snake, and the Lion","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"685","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4848","display_name":"Dee Wykoff"}]},{"id":"101837","section_number":"7","title":"07 Haamdaanee Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"996","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]},{"id":"101838","section_number":"8","title":"08 Haamdaanee Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1205","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]},{"id":"101839","section_number":"9","title":"09 Haamdaanee Part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"829","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]},{"id":"101840","section_number":"10","title":"10 Mkaaah Jeechonee, the Boy Hunter","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1174","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]},{"id":"101841","section_number":"11","title":"11 The Magician and the Sultan\u2019s Son","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"588","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5244","display_name":"Carolin Kaiser"}]},{"id":"101842","section_number":"12","title":"12 The Physician\u2019s Son and the King of the Snakes","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1577","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"},{"id":"11","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
