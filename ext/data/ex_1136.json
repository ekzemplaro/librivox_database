{"books":{"8":{"id":"1136","title":"Chronicles of Canada Volume 06 - The Great Intendant : A Chronicle of Jean Talon in Canada 1665-1672","description":"Talon worked closely with lieutenant-general Prouville de Tracy to achieve the surrender of the Iroquois in 1627, thereby ending the threat that had hung over the colony for 20 years. Although Talon did not join the troops in the field, at Tracy's request, he had a very large share in the success of the French arms through his constant and meticulous care in placing at the disposition of the army everything that was necessary for the war, despite the poverty of the colony, the lack of roads, and the distances.
