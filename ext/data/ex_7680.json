{"books":{"28":{"id":"7680","title":"Patchwork Girl of Oz (version 2)","description":"Yes, this is another wonderful OZ book with all the old familiar characters and some new delightful ones. The Patchwork Girl, a free spirit if ever there was one, is brought to life in this story and then sets out into the wonderful world of OZ to help her friend Ojo find the ingredients for a magic potion to save his Uncle. The five things they need are strange and the places and people they meet along their journey are sometimes dangerous and sometimes funny but the Patchwork Girl always finds humor and fun in all of them. They are accompanied by the Glass Cat who is stuck up and arrogant because of her good looks and 'pink brains'. Another fun book well written by Baum and worth listening to by fans of OZ from 7 to 107.
