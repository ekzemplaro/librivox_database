{"books":{"53":{"id":"1503","title":"Exercises in Knitting","description":"Mrs. Mee, her husband, and her sister ran a yarn and needlework import\/warehouse business in Bath, England. Her books primarily contain practical everyday items that knit up quickly with the busy homemaker in mind. At this time, published knitting \"receipts\" did not contain abbreviations and were laborious to use. They were, however, rich in error! <p>Later in her career, due to circumstances of war and the resulting social stress and poverty, many of her knitting books were printed for ladies' charitable societies, which used her knitting \"receipts\" to clothe the poor mill workers who were out of work due to the American Civil War and the embargo of cotton. <p>In addition to recording the original patterns, LibriVox knitters have also knitted samples of these patterns, displayed at the <a href=\"http:\/\/knitting-and.com\/wiki\/Exercises_in_Knitting\">KntiWiki<\/a>, and have attempted to condense and clarify the patterns for the enjoyment of modern day knitters.
