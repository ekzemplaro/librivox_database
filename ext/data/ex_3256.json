{"books":{"3":{"id":"3256","title":"Westminster Larger Catechism","description":"<p>The Westminster Larger Catechism, along with the Westminster Shorter Catechism, is a central catechism of Calvinists in the English tradition throughout the world. The Westminster Shorter Catechism was to be \"easier to read and concise for beginners\" and the Larger Catechism was to be \"more exact and comprehensive\". The Catechism was completed by the Westminster Assembly in 1647. It was then adopted by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1648 and (with modifications relating to the civil magistrate) by the Presbyterian Synod of New York and Philadelphia in 1788.
