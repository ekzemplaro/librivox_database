{"books":{"33":{"id":"5570","title":"Exploits of Juve","description":"Fant\u00f4mas was introduced a few years after Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fant\u00f4mas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion.\n\nHe is totally ruthless, gives no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fant\u00f4mas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested rats, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.\n\nThe Exploits of Juve chronicles some of Juve\u2019s adventures in pursuit of this master criminal and ends with what may be Fantomas\u2019 revenge on the detective.\n\n(Introduction by Wikipedia and Don Jenkins) <br><br>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30586","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"34","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5570","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/exploits_juve_djw_librivox\/exploits_juve_djw_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-exploits-of-juve-by-marcel-allain-pierre-souvestre\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:46:45","totaltimesecs":20805,"authors":[{"id":"1100","first_name":"Marcel","last_name":"Allain","dob":"1885","dod":"1969"},{"id":"6316","first_name":" Pierre","last_name":"Souvestre","dob":"1874","dod":"1914"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/exploits_juve_djw_librivox","sections":[{"id":"68480","section_number":"1","title":"The Comrade's Tryst","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"924","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5304","display_name":"Don W.
