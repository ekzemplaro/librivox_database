{"books":{"11":{"id":"781","title":"Rewards and Fairies","description":"Joseph Rudyard Kipling (December 30, 1865 \u2013 January 18, 1936) was an English author and poet, born in India, and best known today for his children\u2019s books, including <u>The Jungle Book<\/u>, <u>Just So Stories<\/u>, and <u>Puck of Pook\u2019s Hill<\/u>; his novel, <u>Kim<\/u>; his poems, including \u201cMandalay\u201d, \u201cGunga Din\u201d, and \u201cIf\u2014\u201d; and his many short stories, including \u201cThe Man Who Would Be King\u201d and the collections <u>Life\u2019s Handicap<\/u>, <u>The Day\u2019s Work<\/u>, and <u>Plain Tales from the Hills<\/u>. He is regarded as a major \u201cinnovator in the art of the short story\u201d; his children\u2019s books are enduring classics of children\u2019s literature; and his best work speaks to a versatile and luminous narrative gift.\n\n<p>  Dan and Una met Puck last summer, in <u>Puck of Pook\u2019s Hill<\/u>. This summer, they meet him again - and several individuals from different periods in history, who, while generally not famous themselves, tell their tales of meeting Queen Elizabeth, Francis Drake, George Washington, and other well-known historical figures. Sadly, Dan and Una forget these encounters as soon as they are over, but the reader can enjoy them for years to come!
