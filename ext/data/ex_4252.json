(Tom's mother has died.) Mr. Playfair decides to ship his son off to St. Maure's boarding school \u2014 an all-boys academy run by Jesuits \u2014 to shape him up, as well as to help him make a good preparation for his upcoming First Communion. Tom is less than enthusiastic, but his adventures are just about to begin: life at St. Maure's will not be dull.
