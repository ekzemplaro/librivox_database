{"books":{"4":{"id":"4438","title":"Bridal of Triermain","description":"<p>Scott's The Bridal of Triermain is a rhymed, romantic, narrative poem which weaves together elements of popular English legend using dramatic themes. <br><\/br>This beautiful poem celebrates the exploits of a knight errant - Sir Roland De Vaux - as he seeks to rescue (and hopefully espouse) a beautiful maiden, Gyneth. Gyneth is the illegitimate daughter of King Arthur: doomed by Merlin 500 years previously to an enchanted sleep inside a magic castle. The enchantment can only be broken by a rescuer both brave and noble enough to overcome the temptations used successively to distract and overcome him, namely: fear, wealth, pleasure and pride.<br><\/br>(Introduction by Godsend) <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/bridaltriermain00scotgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1813","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4438","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/bridal_triermain_1007_librivox\/bridal_triermain_1007_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Bridal_of_Triermain_by_Walter_Scott","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-bridal-of-triermain-by-sir-walter-scott\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:03:53","totaltimesecs":7433,"authors":[{"id":"491","first_name":"Sir Walter","last_name":"Scott","dob":"1771","dod":"1832"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/bridal_triermain_1007_librivox","sections":[{"id":"38077","section_number":"0","title":"00 Introduction","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/avs\/thebridaloftriermain_00_scott.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"465","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"38078","section_number":"1","title":"01 Canto First","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/avs\/thebridaloftriermain_01_scott.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1350","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"38079","section_number":"2","title":"02 Canto Second","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/avs\/thebridaloftriermain_02_scott.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2343","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"38080","section_number":"3","title":"03 Canto Third","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/avs\/thebridaloftriermain_03_scott.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3070","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"38081","section_number":"4","title":"04 Conclusion","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/avs\/thebridaloftriermain_04_scott.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"205","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"69","name":"Narratives"}],"translators":[]}}}
