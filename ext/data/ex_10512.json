{"books":{"90":{"id":"10512","title":"Forty-Five Guardsmen","description":"The sequel to \"Chicot the Jester\" and final book of the \"Valois Romances.\" This story begins six years after the famed \"Duel of the Mignons\" between the favorites of the courts of King Henry III and Henry the Duke of Guise (somewhat allied with the King's brother, Francis, Duke of Anjou and Alencon). Dumas concludes his historical fiction on the War of the Three Henries while (1) detailing the formation of the Forty-Five Guardsmen (who were to become the Musketeers), (2) following Chicot the Jester as he stays loyal to the failing regency of King Henry III, and (3) continuing the story of Diana (a principal character in the previous book). - Summary by jvanstan","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/13626\/13626-h\/13626-h.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1893","num_sections":"91","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10512","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_forty-five_guards","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"431","first_name":"Alexandre","last_name":"Dumas","dob":"1802","dod":"1870"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"359092","section_number":"1","title":"The Porte St. Antoine","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_01_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359093","section_number":"2","title":"What passed outside the Porte St. Antoine","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_02_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359094","section_number":"3","title":"The examination","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_03_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359095","section_number":"4","title":"His majesty Henri the Third","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_04_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359096","section_number":"5","title":"The Execution","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_05_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359097","section_number":"6","title":"The Brothers","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_06_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359098","section_number":"7","title":"The sword of the brave chevalier","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_07_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359099","section_number":"8","title":"The gascon","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/darvinia\/fortyfiveguardsmen_08_dumas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"359100","section_number":"9","title":"M.
