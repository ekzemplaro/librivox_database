{"books":{"20":{"id":"2323","title":"Old Peter's Russian Tales","description":"Arthur Ransome is best known for his <i>Swallows and Amazons<\/i> series of children\u2019s books. This is the only example of his fiction in the public domain. These stories are all from Russian folklore, some comparatively well-known, others less so. Ransome spent some years in Russia as a newspaper correspondent for the <i>Daily News<\/i> and the <i>Manchester Guardian<\/i> and was peripherally involved in the revolution. In the late twenties he married Evgenia Shvelpina, Trotsky's secretary, retired from newspapers and started writing his children\u2019s books.
