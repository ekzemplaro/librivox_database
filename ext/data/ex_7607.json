{"books":{"19":{"id":"7607","title":"Peggy Raymond's School Days (or Old Girls And New)","description":"Published in 1916, this third installment with The Friendly Terrace girls places them in The Girl\u2019s High School, with an array of new characters, and a few peripherally known from the first book. A heavier edge of drama comes through via a new student with a superiority complex, another student whose diligent scholastic achievements mar her socially, and an odd tradition of affectionate favouritism between Freshman and Seniors which proves to be awkward and disruptive to more than just the students. Peggy, Amy, Priscilla and Ruth are again faced with new challenges, and complicated scenarios to help resolve.
