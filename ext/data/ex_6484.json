{"books":{"23":{"id":"6484","title":"Satires and Profanities","description":"\"Believing as I do that James Thomson is, since Shelley, the most brilliant genius who has wielded a pen in the service of Freethought, I take a natural pride and pleasure in rescuing the following articles from burial in the great mausoleum of the periodical press. There will doubtless be a diversity of opinion as to their value. One critic, for instance, has called \u201cThe Story of a Famous Old Jewish Firm\u201d a witless squib; but, on the other hand, the late Professor Clifford considered it a piece of exquisite mordant satire worthy of Swift. Such differences are inevitable from the very nature of the subject. Satire, more than any other form of composition, rouses antipathy where it does not command applause; and the greater the satire, the more intense are the feelings it excites.\" (G. W. Foote in his Preface)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/39119","language":"English","copyright_year":"1884","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6484","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/satires_profanities_1208_librivox\/satires_profanities_1208_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/satires-and-profanities-by-james-thomson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:22:44","totaltimesecs":26564,"authors":[{"id":"349","first_name":"George William","last_name":"Foote","dob":"1850","dod":"1915"},{"id":"3259","first_name":"James","last_name":"Thomson","dob":"1834","dod":"1882"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/satires_profanities_1208_librivox","sections":[{"id":"91895","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Preface by G.
