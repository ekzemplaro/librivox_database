{"books":[{"id":"929","title":"Many Voices (selection from)","description":"E. Nesbit (Edith Bland) was a prodigious 19th century children\u2019s writer who produced over 60 books of fiction for children. This book of poems has many elements which would appeal to children but there\u2019s also some exploration of her feelings of love, lust and longing which your average 10 year old would find downright yucky. There are also moments of joy, moments of sugary sweetness and moments of sharp insight in this collection which contains views from many angles. Recurring themes of love, death, gardens and fairies give us a fine insight into the lively imagination of E. Nesbit.
