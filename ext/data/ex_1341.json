{"books":{"1":{"id":"1341","title":"Goody-Naughty Book","description":"<p><i>The Goody-Naughty Book<\/i> was originally published as two books back to back. Opening the book from one end, the reader experiences \"The Goody Side\" where the children are polite and thoughtful. However, turning the book over and beginning from the other side, one reads \"The Naughty Side\" where the children are lazy and irritable. These short, moral stories teach children the proper way to behave and that there are consequences if they don't.<\/p>\n\n<p>To read along and enjoy the illustrations, please visit the HTML version of this text at Project Gutenberg: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/22197\">The Goody-Naughty Book<\/a>.<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/22197","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"2","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1341","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/goody_naughty_librivox\/goody_naughty_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-goody-naughty-book-by-sarah-cory-rippey\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:44:09","totaltimesecs":2649,"authors":[{"id":"4492","first_name":" Sarah Cory","last_name":"Rippey","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/goody_naughty_librivox","sections":[{"id":"143407","section_number":"1","title":"Goody Side, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1233","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"143408","section_number":"2","title":"Naughty Side, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1416","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"},{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"}],"translators":[]}}}
