{"books":{"1":{"id":"4678","title":"Song of Solomon","description":"<p>Also known as <i>Song of Songs<\/i>, <i>Solomon's Song of Songs<\/i>, or as <i>Canticles<\/i>. The protagonists of the Song of Songs are a woman (identified in one verse as \"the Shulamite\") and a man, and the poem suggests movement from courtship to consummation. Additionally, the Song includes a chorus, the \"daughters of Jerusalem.\"<br\/><br\/>\nIn spite of the lack of explicitly religious content, the Song is often interpreted as an allegorical representation of the relationship of God and Israel, or for Christians, God and the Church or Christ and the human soul, as husband and wife.
