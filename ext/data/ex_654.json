{"books":{"18":{"id":"654","title":"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)","description":"<p><i>Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)<\/i>, published in 1889, is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.<p>The book was intended initially to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history of places along the route, but the humorous elements eventually took over, to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages now seem like an unnecessary distraction to the essentially comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers. The jokes seem fresh and witty even today.<p>The three men were based on Jerome himself and two real-life friends, George, and Harris. The dog, Montmorency, however, was entirely fictional, but, as Jerome had remarked, \"had much of me in it.\" (Summary from Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/308","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/654","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/three_men_boat_librivox\/three_men_boat_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Three_Men_in_a_Boat","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/three-men-in-a-boat-by-jerome-k-jerome\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:38:44","totaltimesecs":23924,"authors":[{"id":"529","first_name":"Jerome K.","last_name":"Jerome","dob":"1859","dod":"1927"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/three_men_boat_librivox","sections":[{"id":"130622","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 01","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1338","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"202","display_name":"Geetu Melwani"}]},{"id":"130623","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter  02","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"867","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"130624","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 03","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"965","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"130625","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 04","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1379","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"953","display_name":"Jim Mullins"}]},{"id":"130626","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 05","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1150","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"29","display_name":"Linton"}]},{"id":"130627","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 06","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1286","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"954","display_name":"Brooks Seveer"}]},{"id":"130628","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 07","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1080","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"130629","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 08","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1358","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"130630","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1182","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1260","display_name":"Chris Hughes"}]},{"id":"130631","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1357","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"82","display_name":"Marlo Dianne"}]},{"id":"130632","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1383","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"130633","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1461","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"130634","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1683","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"167","display_name":"Peter Yearsley"}]},{"id":"130635","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 14","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1297","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"517","display_name":"Matthew Walton"}]},{"id":"130636","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter 15","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2168","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"167","display_name":"Peter Yearsley"}]},{"id":"130637","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter 16","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"511","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"373","display_name":"Kim Braun"}]},{"id":"130638","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter 17","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1018","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"283","display_name":"Asaf Bartov"}]},{"id":"130639","section_number":"18","title":"Chapter 18","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"945","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"32","display_name":"Betsie Bush"}]},{"id":"130640","section_number":"19","title":"Chapter 19","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1496","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"167","display_name":"Peter Yearsley"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
