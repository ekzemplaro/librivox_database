{"books":{"11":{"id":"8275","title":"Our Little Siamese Cousin","description":"A book written for children to see what life is like for their 'cousins' in Siam.   This is part of the \"Our Little Cousin\" series and like the others, brings to life the day to day occurrences and celebrations of children around the world that are so different, yet at heart, all the same because children and the parents who love and cherish them are the same too no matter where they live.   This book lets us attend some of their Siamese festivals, take a peep into the royal palace, enter the temples, and learn something about the ways and habits of that far-away eastern country.  - Summary by Phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/43908","language":"English","copyright_year":"1903","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8275","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"9754","first_name":"Mary Hazelton Blanchard","last_name":"Wade","dob":"1860","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"296092","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ourlittlesiamesecousin_00_wade.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8677","display_name":"KHand"}]},{"id":"296093","section_number":"1","title":"The First Birthday","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ourlittlesiamesecousin_01_wade.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8677","display_name":"KHand"}]},{"id":"296094","section_number":"2","title":"Little Chie Lo","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ourlittlesiamesecousin_02_wade.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7495","display_name":"Arlene Joyce"}]},{"id":"296095","section_number":"3","title":"Night on the River","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ourlittlesiamesecousin_03_wade.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7495","display_name":"Arlene Joyce"}]},{"id":"296096","section_number":"4","title":"Work and Play","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ourlittlesiamesecousin_04_wade.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8721","display_name":"Onlam"}]},{"id":"296097","section_number":"5","title":"New Year's","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/ourlittlesiamesecousin_05_wade.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9092","display_name":"Teresa Bauman"}]},{"id":"296098","section_number":"6","title":"White Elephants","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9358","display_name":"Timothy Miller"}]},{"id":"296099","section_number":"7","title":"In the Temple","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"296100","section_number":"8","title":"The Legend of the Peace-Offering","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"296101","section_number":"9","title":"Queer Sights","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"296102","section_number":"10","title":"The Queen's City","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"296103","section_number":"11","title":"The Monsoon","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"48","name":"General"}],"translators":[]}}}
