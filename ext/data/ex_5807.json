This was the Weekly Poetry project for August 21, 2011.<br><br>Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence.( Summary by Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.bartelby.com\/113\/1136.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5807","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/planktoplank_1108_librivox\/planktoplank_1108_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/i-stepped-from-plank-to-plank-by-emily-dickinson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:09:03","totaltimesecs":543,"authors":[{"id":"23","first_name":"Emily","last_name":"Dickinson","dob":"1830","dod":"1886"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/planktoplank_1108_librivox","sections":[{"id":"74224","section_number":"1","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by ALG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"43","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4744","display_name":"Amy Gramour"}]},{"id":"74225","section_number":"2","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"40","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"74226","section_number":"3","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by EP","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"40","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2525","display_name":"loubet"}]},{"id":"74227","section_number":"4","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by EZWA","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"36","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"123","display_name":"Ezwa"}]},{"id":"74228","section_number":"5","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by GB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"44","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"74229","section_number":"6","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by GHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"43","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"74230","section_number":"7","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by HWS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"48","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6776","display_name":"Harvey Spurr"}]},{"id":"74231","section_number":"8","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by JBS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"37","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"77","display_name":"JemmaBlythe"}]},{"id":"74232","section_number":"9","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by LAH","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"43","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"74233","section_number":"10","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by LL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"38","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2758","display_name":"SopranoHarmony"}]},{"id":"74234","section_number":"11","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by LLB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"41","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6707","display_name":"Lewis"}]},{"id":"74235","section_number":"12","title":"I stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by REF","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"40","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2269","display_name":"Rhonda Federman"}]},{"id":"74236","section_number":"13","title":"I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by RN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"50","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3465","display_name":"ravenotation"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"96","name":"Nature"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"},{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"}],"translators":[]}}}
