{"books":{"22":{"id":"9800","title":"Lost Girl","description":"<p>\"There is no mistake about it, Alvina was a lost girl. She was cut off from everything she belonged to.\"\n<p><p>\nIn this most under-valued of his novels, Lawrence once again presents us with a young woman hemmed in by her middle-class upbringing and (like Ursula Brangwen in The Rainbow) longing for escape. Alvina Houghton's plight, however, is given a rather comic and even picaresque treatment. Losing first her mother, a perpetual invalid, and later her cross-dressing father, a woefully ineffectual small-scale entrepreneur, Alvina feels doomed to merge with the tribe of eternal spinsters who surround her in the dreary mining community of Woodhouse.\n<p><p>\nInto this drab environment enter the Natcha-Kee-Tawara: a polyglot, poly-amorous troupe of travelling players united, on- and off-stage, in a fantasy of Native American nomadism. Enter Ciccio, the surly dark-eyed horseman. The Italian's potent and threatening physicality overwhelms Alvina and soon will propel her into - what? Perdition, or the paradoxical freedom of a girl who 'like(s) being lost'?<p> (Summary by Martin Geeson)<p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/23727","language":"English","copyright_year":"1921","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9800","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Lost_Girl","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-lost-girl-by-d-h-lawrence\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"34","first_name":"D.
