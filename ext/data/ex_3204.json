It was intended as a manual for beginners as a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasonings for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God's creation, Man, Man's purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God.(Summary adapted from the Wikipedia)<br><br>These are parts three and four of six parts of the Pars Prima, consisting of questions regarding the Angels, and the Work of the Six Days.<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/17611","language":"English","copyright_year":"1300","num_sections":"25","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3204","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/summa_1_03_1112_librivox\/summa_1_03_1112_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/summa-theologica-03-pars-prima-the-angels-and-the-six-days-by-saint-thomas-aquinas\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:37:57","totaltimesecs":38277,"authors":[{"id":"1199","first_name":"Saint Thomas","last_name":"Aquinas","dob":"1225","dod":"1274"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/summa_1_03_1112_librivox","sections":[{"id":"10327","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
