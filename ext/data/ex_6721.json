{"books":{"13":{"id":"6721","title":"Just Me","description":"<br \/>Perhaps the first memoir written by a film celebrity, Pearl White's <em>Just Me<\/em> gives a first-person account of the actress' rise to stardom. White guides us through her early childhood, her development as a performer, and finally to her breakout role in The Perils of Pauline--a role that made her the most popular \"serial queen\" of early cinema. Although romanticized and somewhat embellished, this book gives us a fascinating glimpse into the film industry's earliest years and the various myths of film stardom.
