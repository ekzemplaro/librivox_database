{"books":{"21":{"id":"4020","title":"Bungay Castle: A Novel","description":"Bungay Castle is a gothic novel by Elizabeth Bonh\u00f4te. It was first published in 1796 and follows the fortunes of the De Morney family at Bungay Castle in Suffolk. Two young members of the family, Roseline and Edwin, search for the source of strange, unearthly cries and discover a terrifying secret in the castle's bowels which will change their lives forever. The story combines the classic Gothic tropes of mystery, betrayal and a heroine in peril in suitably imposing surroundings and has been praised in modern times for its proto-feminist sensibility. The young women in the story keep their fates in their own hands, rather than wait for some dashing hero to come to the rescue.
