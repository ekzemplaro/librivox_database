According to Wikipedia: \"Larcom served as a model for the change in women's roles in society.\" This is her colorful autobiography. Here, she tells about her happy childhood, and her time working in the mill. Along the way, she speaks about topics like morality, independence, love and loss inside a family, a strong belief in god, and the effects of being poor. Fans of Gene Stratton Porter, Fanny Fern and Susan Warner, and Ella Wheeler Wilcox will be delighted with this book. Lucy's sunny personality makes this book a very uplifting and interesting read.\n(Summary by Stav Nisser.)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2293","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5584","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/newenglandgirlhood_1109_librivox\/newenglandgirlhood_1109_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-new-england-girlhood-outlined-from-memory-by-lucy-larcom\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:20:59","totaltimesecs":22859,"authors":[{"id":"2266","first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"Larcom","dob":"1824","dod":"1893"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/newenglandgirlhood_1109_librivox","sections":[{"id":"68885","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Dedication and preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"921","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5538","display_name":"Linda Velwest"}]},{"id":"68886","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Up and Down the Lane","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1828","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5538","display_name":"Linda Velwest"}]},{"id":"68887","section_number":"2","title":"01 - Schoolroom and Meeting-House","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1682","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6505","display_name":"Elena"}]},{"id":"68888","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Hymn-Book","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1397","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6215","display_name":"Janet248"}]},{"id":"68889","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Naughty Children and Fairy Tales","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1604","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6215","display_name":"Janet248"}]},{"id":"68890","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Old New England","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2040","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4744","display_name":"Amy Gramour"}]},{"id":"68891","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Glimpses of Poetry","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1804","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5538","display_name":"Linda Velwest"}]},{"id":"68892","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Beginning to Work","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2079","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5538","display_name":"Linda Velwest"}]},{"id":"68893","section_number":"8","title":"08 - By the River","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2200","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6733","display_name":"Snapdragon"}]},{"id":"68894","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Mountain-Friends","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1560","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6733","display_name":"Snapdragon"}]},{"id":"68895","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Mill Girls' Magazines","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1979","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4744","display_name":"Amy Gramour"}]},{"id":"68896","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Reading and Studying","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1673","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6594","display_name":"Amelia Chantarotwong"}]},{"id":"68897","section_number":"12","title":"12 - From the Merrimack to the Mississippi","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2092","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6594","display_name":"Amelia Chantarotwong"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
