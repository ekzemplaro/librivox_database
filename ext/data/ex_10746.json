They are beautifully written and deserve to be 'told' by readers who enjoy telling stories.      - Summary by Phil chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/51432","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10746","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"8099","first_name":"Laurence","last_name":"Housman","dob":"1865","dod":"1959"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"366086","section_number":"1","title":"The Fisherman and the Genie","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/storiesfromthearabiannights_01_housman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10289","display_name":"Tony Addison"}]},{"id":"366087","section_number":"2","title":"The Story of the King of the Ebony Isles","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/storiesfromthearabiannights_02_housman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"366088","section_number":"3","title":"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/storiesfromthearabiannights_03_housman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"366089","section_number":"4","title":"The Story of the Magic Horse","listen_url":"http:\/\/uploads.librivox.org\/philchenevert\/storiesfromthearabiannights_04_housman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1870","display_name":"Stuart Bell"}]},{"id":"366090","section_number":"5","title":"The Story of the Wicked Half-Brothers","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/storiesfromthearabiannights_05_housman_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4044","display_name":"serenitylee"}]},{"id":"366091","section_number":"6","title":"The Story of the Princess of Deryaba","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10751","display_name":"Calaeryn Llewellyn Williams"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"11","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
