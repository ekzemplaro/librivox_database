{"books":{"21":{"id":"3657","title":"How to Sing (Meine Gesangskunst)","description":"<br \/>Lilli Lehmann, born Elisabeth Maria Lehmann, was a German operatic soprano of phenomenal versatility. She was also a voice teacher.<BR \/><BR \/>She wrote: \"Every serious artist has a sincere desire to help others reach the goal\u2014the goal toward which all singers are striving: to sing well and beautifully.\" This is the 1915 second (expanded) edition of her book, and the accompanying <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/howtosingmeinege00lehmuoft\" target=\"_blank\">online book scan<\/a> includes many illustrations and diagrams, both physiological and musical, which the listener will find useful.<BR \/><BR \/>Much of Lilli Lehmann's advice is complex and demanding - the standards which she set for herself were beyond the highest aspirations of most professional singers. However, there is still much in this book that is enlightening to all those who are interested in using their voice to best advantage, both in song and the spoken word.
