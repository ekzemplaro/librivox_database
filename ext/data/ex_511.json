{"books":{"53":{"id":"511","title":"Collected Public Domain Poems of Wallace Stevens, Volume 1","description":"<p>A collection of poems by Wallace Stevens published before 1923.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trained as a lawyer, within eleven years after these poems were written he was a vice-president at the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company in Connecticut. He continued to pursue a quiet life of poetry and correspondence and for the remainder of his life nurtured his contemplative habit of observation and writing as he walked from home to work and back again. Few at Hartford knew of his world acclaim as a poet. While his major work is considered to have been written when he was much older, many of these early poems are firm classics in the American poetic canon, including: Anecdote of the Jar, The Emperor of Ice Cream, Peter Quince at the Clavier, Sunday Morning, Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird, and others. Stevens died of cancer in 1955, not long after receiving the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.<\/p>\n\n<p>All poems and recordings are in the public domain. This collection was recorded for LibriVox.org.<\/p>\n\n<p>(Summary by Alan Davis-Drake)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.drakesdoor.org\/podcasts\/ws\/stevens_public_domain.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"54","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/511","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/poems_of_wallace_stevens_volume_1_add_librivox\/poems_of_wallace_stevens_volume_1_add_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-complete-public-domain-poems-of-wallace-stevens-volume-1-of-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:07:39","totaltimesecs":4059,"authors":[{"id":"332","first_name":"Wallace","last_name":"Stevens","dob":"1879","dod":"1955"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/poems_of_wallace_stevens_volume_1_add_librivox","sections":[{"id":"128349","section_number":"1","title":"Anecdote
