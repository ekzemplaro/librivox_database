{"books":{"30":{"id":"10231","title":"Cousin Pons","description":"Cousin Pons is one of the final works in Balzac's long novel series titled The Human Comedy. It was published in 1847 as part of a contrasting novel pair titled Poor Relations. The first novel in this pair was Cousin Betty, about a bitter and resentful woman who seeks revenge on her wealthier relations. In Cousin Pons, Balzac turns to the story of an innocent man who is exploited and victimized by the wealthier members of his family. Balzac offers a detailed portrait of mid-19th-century French life and probing character analyses, as well as an indictment of greed and materialism. He is considered one of the finest European novelists of his century and a significant influence on the development of literary realism.
