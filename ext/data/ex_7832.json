{"books":{"15":{"id":"7832","title":"Youth and the Bright Medusa, and The Troll Garden","description":"Youth And The Bright Medusa comprises eight short stories published in 1920. Four of them (The Sculptor\u2019s Funeral; A Death In The Desert; A Wagner Matinee; Paul\u2019s Case) are re-worked from an earlier collection, The Troll Garden, published in 1905. This Librivox recording contains in addition the three stories (Flavia And Her Artists; The Garden Lodge; The Marriage Of Phaedra) from that earlier work omitted in the later book. In other words, all the stories in both books are recorded here.
