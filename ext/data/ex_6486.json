This was the Weekly Poetry project for March 18, 2012.<br><br>Oscar Wilde, an Irish author who lived for much of his life in London, is most famous for his witty, satirical plays. He also worked for some time as a journalist.<br><br>Much of his poetry was written early in his career, with a notable exception being The Ballad of Reading Gaol. This poem, Symphony in Yellow, is probably one of his earlier works; in it he describes London in a flattering manner something he was disinclined to do after his trial and imprisonment.<br>(Summary by Lucy Perry)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1031","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6486","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/symphony_yellow_1203_librivox\/symphony_yellow_1203_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/symphony-in-yellow-by-oscar-wilde\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:18:48","totaltimesecs":1128,"authors":[{"id":"114","first_name":"Oscar","last_name":"Wilde","dob":"1854","dod":"1900"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/symphony_yellow_1203_librivox","sections":[{"id":"91957","section_number":"1","title":"Symphony in Yellow -
