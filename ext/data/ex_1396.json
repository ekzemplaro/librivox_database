{"books":{"19":{"id":"1396","title":"Shakespeare Monologues Collection vol. 04","description":"<p>LibriVox readers present the fourth collection of monologues from Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Containing 20 parts.\nWilliam Shakespeare (April 26, 1564 \u2013 April 23, 1616) remains widely to be considered the single greatest playwright of all time. He wrote in such a variety of genres - tragedy, comedy, romance, &c - that there is always at least one monologue in each of his plays. Some of these teach a lesson, some simply characterize Shakespeare at his best, some are funny, some sad, but all are very moving. Each monologue will touch everybody differently. Some people will be so moved by a particular monologue that they will want to record it.
