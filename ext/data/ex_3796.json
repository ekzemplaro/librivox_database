{"books":{"11":{"id":"3796","title":"Eros and Psyche","description":"Bridges' Eros and Psyche retells the Eros (= Cupid) and Psyche myth first recorded by Lucius Apuleius in his book The Golden Ass.\n\nThe poem is divided into twelve cantos - one for each of the twelve months of the year - which gives the poem a certain, almost \"pastoral\" feel. The number of stanzas in each canto equals the number of days in that month: so the first canto March has 31 stanzas, the second canto April has 30 stanzas, and so on. Each stanza is a septet (ie comprises exactly seven lines) which follow the same end-rhyming schema of a-b-a-b-c-c-b.(Summary by Godsend) <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/cu31924013439025","language":"English","copyright_year":"1885","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3796","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/eros_psyche_n_librivox\/eros_psyche_n_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cupid_and_Psyche","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/eros-and-psyche-by-robert-bridges\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:11:49","totaltimesecs":7909,"authors":[{"id":"277","first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Bridges","dob":"1844","dod":"1930"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/eros_psyche_n_librivox","sections":[{"id":"20215","section_number":"1","title":"March","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"642","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20216","section_number":"2","title":"April","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"625","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20217","section_number":"3","title":"May","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"651","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20218","section_number":"4","title":"June","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"628","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20219","section_number":"5","title":"July","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"650","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20220","section_number":"6","title":"August","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"652","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20221","section_number":"7","title":"September","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"656","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20222","section_number":"8","title":"October","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"685","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20223","section_number":"9","title":"November","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"676","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20224","section_number":"10","title":"December","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"694","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20225","section_number":"11","title":"January","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"714","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]},{"id":"20226","section_number":"12","title":"February","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"636","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3793","display_name":"Nathan"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"68","name":"Lyric"}],"translators":[]}}}
