{"books":{"19":{"id":"5593","title":"Shakespeare Monologues Collection vol. 10 (Multilingual)","description":"LibriVox readers present the tenth collection of monologues from Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Containing 20 parts. William Shakespeare (April 26, 1564 \u2013 April 23, 1616) remains widely to be considered the single greatest playwright of all time. He wrote in such a variety of genres \u2013 tragedy, comedy, romance, &c \u2013 that there is always at least one monologue in each of his plays. Some of these teach a lesson, some simply characterize Shakespeare at his best, some are funny, some sad, but all are very moving. Each monologue will touch everybody differently. Some people will be so moved by a particular monologue that they will want to record it. (Summary by Shurtagal) In a departure from previous collections we are including versions from the many languages to which his works have been translated.","url_text_source":"","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5593","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/shakespeare_monologues10_1112_librivox\/shakespeare_monologues10_1112_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shakespeare","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/multilingual-shakespeare-monologues-collection-010-by-william-shakespeare\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:50:40","totaltimesecs":3040,"authors":[{"id":"37","first_name":"William","last_name":"Shakespeare","dob":"1654","dod":"1616"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/shakespeare_monologues10_1112_librivox","sections":[{"id":"69153","section_number":"1","title":"Redeeming Time Act 1, Scene 2 - Henry IV","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"115","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6446","display_name":"Bob Gonzalez"}]},{"id":"69154","section_number":"2","title":"Act 2, Scene 3 - Richard II","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"154","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3536","display_name":"Arielle Lipshaw"}]},{"id":"69155","section_number":"3","title":"O Pardon Me Thou Bleeding Piece of Earth - Julius Caesar","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"99","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5506","display_name":"Frank Booker"}]},{"id":"69156","section_number":"4","title":"Upon the King - Henry V","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"354","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6717","display_name":"Tony Scheinman"}]},{"id":"69157","section_number":"5","title":"But I do think it is their husbands' fault - Othello","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"108","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]},{"id":"69158","section_number":"6","title":"Kate's Monologue - The Taming of the Shrew","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"192","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6733","display_name":"Snapdragon"}]},{"id":"69159","section_number":"7","title":"How sweet the moonlight.. - The Merchant of Venice","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"177","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5694","display_name":"Winston Tharp"}]},{"id":"69160","section_number":"8","title":"To be or not to be - Hamlet","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"156","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6778","display_name":"Morgan Dryden"}]},{"id":"69161","section_number":"9","title":"Methinks I am a prophet, new inspired - Richard II","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"157","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6609","display_name":"Patrick Wallace"}]},{"id":"69162","section_number":"10","title":"O Romeo, Romeo - from Romeo and Juliet","listen_url":"","language":"French","playtime":"110","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"69163","section_number":"11","title":"If we shadows have offended - Midsummer Night\\'s Dream","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"85","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"69164","section_number":"12","title":"[GERMAN] Mich d\u00e4ucht, ich bin ein neubegeisterter Prophet","listen_url":"","language":"German","playtime":"201","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6609","display_name":"Patrick Wallace"}]},{"id":"69165","section_number":"13","title":"I Left no Ring with Her - Twelfth Night","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"138","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6099","display_name":"Cheri Gardner"}]},{"id":"69166","section_number":"14","title":"M, O, A, I, - Twelfth Night","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"255","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6824","display_name":"R.
