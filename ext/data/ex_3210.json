{"books":{"5":{"id":"3210","title":"Pippa Passes","description":"<p> Pippa Passes was a dramatic piece, as much play as poetry, by Robert Browning published in 1841 as the first volume of his Bells and Pomegranates series.\n\nThe author described the work as the first of a series of dramatic pieces. His original idea was of a young, innocent girl, moving unblemished through the crime-ridden neighbourhoods of Asolo. The work caused outrage when it was first published, due to the matter-of-fact portrayals of many of the area's more disreputable characters \u2013 notably the adulterous Ottima \u2013 and for its frankness on sexual matters. Perhaps the most famous passage is below:<br><br>The year's at the spring,<br>\nAnd day's at the morn;<br>\nMorning's at seven;<br>\nThe hill-side's dew-pearled;<br>\nThe lark's on the wing;<br>\nThe snail's on the thorn;<br>\nGod's in his Heaven - <br>\nAll's right with the world!
