{"books":{"18":{"id":"9324","title":"Song Celestial; Or, Bhagavad-G\u00eet\u00e2","description":"This famous and marvellous Sanskrit poem occurs as an episode of the Mahabharata, in the sixth\u2014or \u201cBhishma\u201d\u2014Parva of the great Hindoo epic. It enjoys immense popularity and authority in India, where it is reckoned as one of the \u201cFive Jewels,\u201d\u2014pancharatnani\u2014of Devanagiri literature. In plain but noble language it unfolds a philosophical system which remains to this day the prevailing Brahmanic belief, blending as it does the doctrines of Kapila, Patanjali, and the Vedas. So lofty are many of its declarations, so sublime its aspirations, so pure and tender its piety, that Schlegel, after his study of the poem, breaks forth into this outburst of delight and praise towards its unknown author.
