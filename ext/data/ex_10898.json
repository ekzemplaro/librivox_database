Mark Spencer is about to give up on writing his sermon one Saturday night when the Devil comes to him and tries to discourage him by reminding him how few of the people who have pledged themselves to make their motto, 'For Christ and the Church' keep it.

A sermon that urges them to pledge themselves again to Christ and the Church! - Summary by Esther ben Simonides","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/forchristandchu00shelgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1899","num_sections":"31","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10898","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"435","first_name":"Charles Monroe","last_name":"Sheldon","dob":"1857","dod":"1946"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"371107","section_number":"1","title":"Rev.
