{"books":{"11":{"id":"7775","title":"Moving the Mountain","description":"Moving the Mountain is a feminist utopian novel written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. It was published serially in Perkins Gilman's periodical The Forerunner and then in book form, both in 1911. The book was one element in the major wave of utopian and dystopian literature that marked the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The novel was also the first volume in Gilman's utopian trilogy; it was followed by the famous Herland (1915) and its sequel, With Her in Ourland (1916). John Robertson, lost in Tibet for thirty years, is finally brought back to America by his sister Nellie, only to find his society completely transformed.
