{"books":{"47":{"id":"2938","title":"Beetle","description":"<br \/>A story about a mysterious oriental figure who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh's novel is of a piece with other sensational turn-of-the-century fictions such as Stoker's Dracula, George du Maurier's Trilby, and Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu novels. Like <em>Dracula<\/em> and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, <em>The Beetle<\/em> is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late nineteenth-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense.<br \/><br \/>\n\nRichard Marsh was the pseudonym of the British author born Richard Bernard Heldmann.
