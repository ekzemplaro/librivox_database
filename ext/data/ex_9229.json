{"books":{"33":{"id":"9229","title":"Life and marvelous adventures of Wild Bill, the Scout","description":"BEING A TRUE AND EXACT HISTORY OF ALL THE SANGUINARY COMBATS AND HAIR-BREADTH ESCAPES OF THE MOST FAMOUS SCOUT\nAND SPY AMERICA EVER PRODUCED.    \"Wild Bill, as a frontier character of the daring, cunning and honorable class, stands alone, without a prototype; his originality is as conspicuous as his remarkable escapades. He was desperate without being a desperado; a fighter without that disposition which invites danger or craves the excitement of an encounter. He killed many men, but in every instance it was either in self-defense or in the prosecution of a duty which he deemed justifiable. Wild Bill was a necessary character in the Far West during the period which marked his career. He was essentially a civilizer, in the sense of a vigilance posse. The law and order class found in him an effective agent for the correction of the lawless; it was fighting the desperate with one of their kind, and Bill had the cunning to remain on the side of society and to always flank his enemies.\"   - Summary by from the book","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/46927","language":"English","copyright_year":"1880","num_sections":"34","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9229","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10900","first_name":"J.
