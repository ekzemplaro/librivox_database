In 1919, assisted by the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, she published a booklet titled Heart Stories to benefit war charities. During this time she regularly lectured on topics such as temperance and suffragism. She used the pseudonym Katherine Kent for some of her writing.\n\nAfter her death, fellow female journalist Bride Broder wrote in tribute:\n\"There is a simplicity about Mrs. Blewett's prose and verse that has made a wide appeal, and her gay-hearted attitude to life, the humorous twists she gave to little things, made her very welcome as a speaker at women's gatherings. In all her writings she touched on the things that appeal to women everywhere and, in doing so, won the admiration of men readers also.\" (Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/35779","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10590","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"9964","first_name":"Jean McKishnie","last_name":"Blewett","dob":"1862","dod":"1934"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"361271","section_number":"1","title":"Chore Time - Read BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"361269","section_number":"2","title":"Chore Time - Read BSD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_bsd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10402","display_name":"Brian Darby"}]},{"id":"361265","section_number":"3","title":"Chore Time - Read DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"361268","section_number":"4","title":"Chore Time - Read EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"361266","section_number":"5","title":"Chore Time - Read GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"361270","section_number":"6","title":"Chore Time - Read LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"361267","section_number":"7","title":"Chore Time - Read MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"361272","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361273","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361274","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361275","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361276","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361277","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361278","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361279","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361280","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361281","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361282","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361283","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"361284","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
