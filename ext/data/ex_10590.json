During this time she regularly lectured on topics such as temperance and suffragism. She used the pseudonym Katherine Kent for some of her writing.<br>\n\nAfter her death, fellow female journalist Bride Broder wrote in tribute:\n\"There is a simplicity about Mrs. Blewett's prose and verse that has made a wide appeal, and her gay-hearted attitude to life, the humorous twists she gave to little things, made her very welcome as a speaker at women's gatherings. In all her writings she touched on the things that appeal to women everywhere and, in doing so, won the admiration of men readers also.\" (Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/35779","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10590","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox\/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/chore-time-by-jean-mckishnie-blewett\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:23:50","totaltimesecs":1430,"authors":[{"id":"9964","first_name":"Jean McKishnie","last_name":"Blewett","dob":"1862","dod":"1934"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"361271","section_number":"1","title":"Chore Time - Read BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"177","file_name":"choretime_blewett_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"361269","section_number":"2","title":"Chore Time - Read BSD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_bsd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"166","file_name":"choretime_blewett_bsd_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10402","display_name":"Brian Darby"}]},{"id":"361265","section_number":"3","title":"Chore Time - Read DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"174","file_name":"choretime_blewett_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"361268","section_number":"4","title":"Chore Time - Read EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"167","file_name":"choretime_blewett_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"361272","section_number":"5","title":"Chore Time - Read GF","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_gf_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"202","file_name":"choretime_blewett_gf_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10573","display_name":"Gloria Fontaine"}]},{"id":"361266","section_number":"6","title":"Chore Time - Read GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"177","file_name":"choretime_blewett_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"361270","section_number":"7","title":"Chore Time - Read LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"184","file_name":"choretime_blewett_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"361267","section_number":"8","title":"Chore Time - Read MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/choretime_blewett_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"183","file_name":"choretime_blewett_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
