{"books":{"22":{"id":"5491","title":"History of Mr. Polly","description":"<br \/>A funny and touching account of the imaginative Mr. Polly who, bored and trapped in his conventional life, makes a U-turn \u2013- and changes everything.<br \/><br \/>H.G. Wells\u2019 early life as the son of a semi-insolvent shopkeeper and as a draper\u2019s apprentice fueled his novels of the lower middle class: The Wheels of Chance (1896), Kipps (1905), and The History of Mr. Polly (1910). These works evoke the desperation of apprentices, clerks, and small traders in their monotonous toil behind shop counters. And, like Mr. Polly, his protagonists make a break from their mundane lives with more or less success.<br \/><br \/>H. G. Wells (1866-1946) was a prolific writer in history, general and science fiction, and politics. He was a lifelong socialist.
