The title is from him.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Mr Watson is a widowed clergyman with two sons and four daughters. The youngest daughter, Emma, has been brought up by a wealthy aunt and is consequently better educated and more refined than her sisters. But when her aunt contracts a foolish second marriage, Emma is obliged to return to her father's house. There she is chagrined by the crude and reckless husband-hunting of two of her twenty-something sisters.\n<br \/>(Summary from Gesine and Wikipedia)<\/p>\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/austen.classicauthors.net\/watsons\/","language":"English","copyright_year":"1871","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2666","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/watsons_0812_ge_librivox\/watsons_0812_ge_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Watsons","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-watsons-by-jane-austen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:48:26","totaltimesecs":6506,"authors":[{"id":"155","first_name":"Jane","last_name":"Austen","dob":"1775","dod":"1817"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/watsons_0812_ge_librivox","sections":[{"id":"170154","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1611","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"170155","section_number":"2","title":"Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1397","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"170156","section_number":"3","title":"Part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"942","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"170157","section_number":"4","title":"Part 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"528","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"170158","section_number":"5","title":"Part 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1622","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"170159","section_number":"6","title":"Part 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"406","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
