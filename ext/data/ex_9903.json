{"books":{"51":{"id":"9903","title":"Robin Hood","description":"Robin Hood is a heroic outlaw found in English folklore who, according to legend, was also a highly skilled archer and swordsman. He is often portrayed as \"robbing from the rich and giving to the poor\" alongside his band of \"Merry Men\". Robin Hood became a popular folk figure in the late-medieval period, and continues to be widely represented in modern literature, films and television. This version was written and recorded as a play for children.
