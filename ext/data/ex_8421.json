{"books":{"14":{"id":"8421","title":"Noble Woman The Life-Story of Edith Cavell","description":"<p>Edith L. Cavell (1865\u20131915) was a British nurse who attended to soldiers of both sides during World War I, and helped some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium, for which she was arrested, court-martialed, found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. Attempts to mount an appeal failed, and she was summarily executed within hours of the sentence by a German firing squad. Publication of the news prompted spontaneous grief and worldwide condemnation. Many memorials were created around the world, including a statue adjacent to Trafalgar Square in London. --Adapted from Wikipedia\n<br><br>\nNOTE: After recording Chapter 7, the reader became aware that the subject's family pronounced the surname as it rhymes with \"gravel\", and he therefore pronounces it CAvel in subsequent chapters.\n<br><br>\nThe first edition of this book was published in 1916. The final portion of Chapter 15 is from a later edition.
