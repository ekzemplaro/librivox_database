{"books":{"12":{"id":"10830","title":"Sonnet 130","description":"A LibriVox Weekly Poetry tribute to William Shakespeare marking  the 400th anniversary of the Bard's death in April 2016.                                       Two of Shakespeare's most famous sonnets, Sonnet 18 and Sonnet 130, have completely contradict each-other and offer differing views on love and love poetry. Whereas Sonnet 18 is the nice cute cliched one, Sonnet 130 provides a more realistic, almost rhetorical view of love and both would be incredibly popular. This project features Sonnet 130. - Summary by catrose ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1041","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10830","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/sonnet_130_1604.poem_librivox\/sonnet_130_1604.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shakespeare's_sonnets","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/sonnet-130-by-william-shakespeare-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:16:19","totaltimesecs":979,"authors":[{"id":"37","first_name":"William","last_name":"Shakespeare","dob":"1554","dod":"1616"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/sonnet_130_1604.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"368371","section_number":"1","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"67","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"368378","section_number":"2","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"77","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"368379","section_number":"3","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"77","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"368377","section_number":"4","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by GB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_gb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"76","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_gb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"368374","section_number":"5","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"84","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"368381","section_number":"6","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"74","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"368372","section_number":"7","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by KE","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_ke_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_ke_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7510","display_name":"Kathrine Engan"}]},{"id":"368369","section_number":"8","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"76","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_lah_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"368380","section_number":"9","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"81","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"368376","section_number":"10","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"90","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"368375","section_number":"11","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by NB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_nb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"76","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_nb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6965","display_name":"NoelBadrian"}]},{"id":"368370","section_number":"12","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by PS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_ps_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"66","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_ps_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8576","display_name":"Phil Schempf"}]},{"id":"368373","section_number":"13","title":"Sonnet 130 - Read by TP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sonnet130_shakespeare_tp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"67","file_name":"sonnet130_shakespeare_tp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10789","display_name":"Tomas Peter"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
