{"books":{"33":{"id":"5494","title":"Four Feathers","description":"The Four Feathers is a 1902 adventure novel by British writer A.E.W. Mason that has inspired many films of the same title.\nThe novel tells the story of British officer, Harry Feversham, who resigns his commission in the East Surrey Regiment just prior to Sir Garnet Wolseley's 1882 expedition to Egypt to suppress the rising of Urabi Pasha. He is faced with censure from three of his comrades for cowardice, signified by the delivery of three white feathers to him, from Captain Trench and Lieutenants Castleton and Willoughby, and the loss of the support of his Irish fianc\u00e9e, Ethne Eustace, who presents him with the fourth feather. His best friend in the regiment, Captain Durrance becomes his rival for Ethne.<br>(Summary extracted from Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/18883","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"34","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5494","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/four_feathers_1203_librivox\/four_feathers_1203_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Four_Feathers","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-four-feathers-by-a-e-w-mason-2\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"11:26:44","totaltimesecs":41204,"authors":[{"id":"2117","first_name":"A.
