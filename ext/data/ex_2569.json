{"books":{"36":{"id":"2569","title":"Southern Arabia","description":"James Bent was an English explorer , archeologist and author. With his wife, Bent  visited at considerable risk the almost unknown Hadramut country (1893\u20131894), and during this and later journeys in southern Arabia he studied the ancient history of the country, its physical features and actual condition.  While on another journey in South Arabia and Socotra (1896\u20131897), Bent was seized with malarial fever, and died in London on 5 May 1897, a few days after his return.\nMrs Bent, who had contributed by her skill as a photographer and in other ways to the success of her husband's journeys, published in 1900 Southern Arabia, Soudan and Sakotra, which she recorded the results of their last expedition into those regions.
