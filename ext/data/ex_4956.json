{"books":{"7":{"id":"4956","title":"Union and Communion - or Thoughts on the Song of Solomon","description":"This little book, whose design is to lead the devout Bible student into the Green Pastures of the Good Shepherd, thence to the Banqueting House of the King, and thence to the service of the Vineyard, is one of the abiding legacies of Mr. Hudson Taylor to the Church. In the power of an evident unction from the Holy One, he has been enabled herein to unfold in simplest language the deep truth of the believer's personal union with the Lord, which under symbol and imagery is the subject of The Song of Songs. (From the Foreword by J Stuart Holden).","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/26172","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4956","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/union_and_communion_db_librivox\/union_and_communion_db_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/union-and-communion-or-thoughts-on-the-song-of-solomon-by-j-hudson-taylor\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:07:42","totaltimesecs":7662,"authors":[{"id":"1534","first_name":"J.
