{"books":{"22":{"id":"7861","title":"Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel","description":"Chatterer the Red Squirrel finds himself in trouble again and is forced to abandon his old home. As the search for a new home begins, Chatterer's curiosity gets the better of him and a moment of carelessness causes him to stumble into a far different home than he ever imagined. This book is Thornton W.
