{"books":{"87":{"id":"10735","title":"Caliban by the Yellow Sands","description":"Caliban, the primitive, savage son of the witch Sycorax and the evil frog-tiger god Setebos, seeks to obtain knowledge and become civilized from a strange magician named Prospero and his young daughter, Miranda. Through fantastic visions (including of other Shakespeare plays), poetry, song and dance, thus begins the slow, gradual education of a inquisitive brute as he faces enlightenment and wicked temptation. \n\nServing as a thematic companion piece and maybe spiritual prequel and midquel to William Shakespeare's [i]The Tempest[\/i], [i]Caliban by the Yellow Sands[\/i] was a massive, elaborate and outdoor \"community masque\" performed from 1916-1917 in New York and Boston as part of the three-hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's death. Preaching an anti-war message in response to the current events of World War I, it was a smashing success, as it was seen by over two hundred thousand spectators and utilized 1500 amateur artisans and actors to bring its giant vision to life.  - Summary by Mary
