{"books":{"11":{"id":"8536","title":"New Life (La vita nuova)","description":"One of Dante's earliest works, La vita nuova or La vita nova (The New Life) is in a prosimetrum style, a combination of prose and verse, and tells the story of his youthful love for Beatrice. The prose creates the illusion of narrative continuity between the poems; it is Dante's way of reconstructing himself and his art in terms of his evolving sense of the limitations of courtly love (the system of ritualized love and art that Dante and his poet-friends inherited from the Proven\u00e7al poets, the Sicilian poets of the court of Frederick II, and the Tuscan poets before them). Sometime in his twenties, Dante decided to try to write love poetry that was less centered on the self and more aimed at love as such: he intended to elevate courtly love poetry, many of its tropes and its language, into sacred love poetry. Beatrice for Dante was the embodiment of this kind of love\u2014transparent to the Absolute, inspiring the integration of desire aroused by beauty with the longing of the soul for divine splendor. - Summary by adapted from Wikipedia by Mary J","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/41085","language":"English","copyright_year":"1899","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8536","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/newlife_1401_librivox\/newlife_1401_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/La_Vita_Nuova","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-new-life-la-vita-nuova-by-dante-alighieri\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:01:38","totaltimesecs":7298,"authors":[{"id":"1189","first_name":"Dante","last_name":"Alighieri","dob":"1265","dod":"1321"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/newlife_1401_librivox","sections":[{"id":"302196","section_number":"0","title":"Prefatory Note and Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_00_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"714","file_name":"newlife_00_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302197","section_number":"1","title":"Section 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_01_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"441","file_name":"newlife_01_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302198","section_number":"2","title":"Section 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_02_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"453","file_name":"newlife_02_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302199","section_number":"3","title":"Section 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_03_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"627","file_name":"newlife_03_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302200","section_number":"4","title":"Section 4","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_04_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"589","file_name":"newlife_04_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302201","section_number":"5","title":"Section 5","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_05_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"686","file_name":"newlife_05_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302202","section_number":"6","title":"Section 6","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_06_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"505","file_name":"newlife_06_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302203","section_number":"7","title":"Section 7","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_07_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"739","file_name":"newlife_07_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302204","section_number":"8","title":"Section 8","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_08_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"584","file_name":"newlife_08_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302205","section_number":"9","title":"Section 9","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_09_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"782","file_name":"newlife_09_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302206","section_number":"10","title":"Section 10","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_10_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"631","file_name":"newlife_10_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]},{"id":"302207","section_number":"11","title":"Section 11","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/gypsygirl\/newlife_11_alighieri.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"547","file_name":"newlife_11_alighieri_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8842","display_name":"Mary J"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"27","name":"Romance"},{"id":"63","name":"Single author"},{"id":"68","name":"Lyric"},{"id":"69","name":"Narratives"},{"id":"70","name":"Sonnets"},{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[{"id":"600","first_name":"Dante Gabriel","last_name":"Rossetti","dob":"1828","dod":"1882"}]}}}
