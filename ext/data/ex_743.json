The book portrays a parricide in which each of a murdered man's sons share a varying degree of complicity. The Brothers Karamazov is a passionate philosophical novel that explores deep into the ethical debates of God, free will, and morality. It is a spiritual drama of moral struggles concerning faith, doubt, reason, and modern Russia. Since its publication, it has been acclaimed all over the world by thinkers as diverse as Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, and Pope Benedict XVI as one of the supreme achievements in literature. \n(Summary by Wikipedia)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/28054","language":"English","copyright_year":"1880","num_sections":"96","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/743","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/brothers_karamazov_1002_librivox\/brothers_karamazov_1002_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Brothers_Karamazov_(novel)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-brothers-karamazov-by-fyodor-dostoyevsky\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"37:55:17","totaltimesecs":136517,"authors":[{"id":"439","first_name":"Fyodor","last_name":"Dostoyevsky","dob":"1821","dod":"1881"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/brothers_karamazov_1002_librivox","sections":[{"id":"663","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Book 1 Chapter 1 - Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"473","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"664","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Book 1 Chapter 2 - He Gets Rid of His Oldest Son","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"414","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"665","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Book 1 Chapter 3 - The Second Marrage And The Second Family","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"865","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"666","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Book 1 Chapter 4 - The Third Son, Alyosha","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1521","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2825","display_name":"Ernst Pattynama"}]},{"id":"667","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Book 1 Chapter 5 - Elders","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1193","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"668","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Book 2 Chapter 1 - They Arrive at the Monastery","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"641","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"669","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Book 2 Chapter 2 - The Old Buffoon","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1307","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"670","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Book 2 Chapter 3 - Peasant Women Who Have Faith","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1203","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"671","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Book 2 Chapter 4 - A Lady of Little Faith","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1108","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"920","display_name":"Sarah Bean"}]},{"id":"672","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Book 2 Chapter 5 - So Be it!
