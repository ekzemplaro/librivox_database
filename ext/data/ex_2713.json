{"books":{"44":{"id":"2713","title":"Journals of Robert Falcon Scott Vol 1","description":"Capt. Robert F. Scott's bid to be the leader of the first expedition to reach the South Pole is one of the most famous journeys of all time. What started as a scientific expedition turned out to be an unwilling race against a team lead by R. Admunsen to reach the Pole. The Norwegian flag already stood at the end of the trail when Scott's party reached their target. All the five men of the Scott expedition who took part in the last march to the Pole perished on their way back to safety.\n\nRobert F. Scott kept a journal throughout the journey, all the way to the tragic end, documenting all aspects of the expedition. The famous last words of the journal were: 'It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more. For God's sake look after our people.'<br> \n                          (Summary by Illiterati)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/11579","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"45","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2713","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/scott_vol1_2010_librivox\/scott_vol1_2010_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-journals-of-robert-falcon-scott-vol-1-by-robert-falcon-scott\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"19:11:50","totaltimesecs":69110,"authors":[{"id":"6300","first_name":" Leonard","last_name":"Huxley","dob":"1860","dod":"1933"},{"id":"294","first_name":"Robert Falcon","last_name":"Scott","dob":"1868","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/scott_vol1_2010_librivox","sections":[{"id":"6516","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
