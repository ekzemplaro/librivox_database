As a tale, it is swift, simple, and absorbing, and one does not willingly put it down until it is finished. It has to do with grain-elevator business, with railways, strikes, and commercial and financial matters generally, woven skilfully into a human story of love.\" --<i>The Commercial Advertiser<\/i><\/p><p>\"'Calumet \"K\"' is a novel that is exciting and absorbing, but not the least bit sensational.
