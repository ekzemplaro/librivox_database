{"books":{"29":{"id":"9772","title":"Gossip In The First Decade Of Victoria's Reign","description":"\"I have written this Gossip not only for the edification of those to whom a portion, more or less, may be news, but for those who, like myself, have lived through the whole of Queen Victoria's reign, to whom the remembrance of things, almost forgotten, may bring pleasure and excite interest. The items, herein displayed, have been gathered from many sources, and their authenticity is guaranteed by giving the name of the authority whence they were taken, in very many instances ipsissima verba, as paraphrasing would rob them of their freshness and individuality.  (From Author\u2019s Preface)  Gossip here should be understood as informal, unrestrained talk or writing, esp. about people or social incidents.  (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary).  John Ashton was an historian and a prolific writer, unjustly forgotten, of social mores, customs, and daily life of the English Regency as well as before and after.  This book about Victoria\u2019s early reign is the last of some thirty books about various preceding eras.  The chapter titles here contain only a couple of the many interesting people and events contained in the chapter.\n - Summary by Author's Preface and david wales","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/gossipinfirstde00ashtgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1903","num_sections":"30","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9772","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11280","first_name":"John","last_name":"Ashton","dob":"1834","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"336411","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_00_ashton,_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336412","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1  1837  The Queen's Accession, Funeral Of The King, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_01_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336413","section_number":"2","title":"Ch 2  1837  Thames Tunnel Flooded, First Mention Of The Nelson Column, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_02_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336414","section_number":"3","title":"Ch 3  1838  Destruction Of The Royal Exchange, Sale Of The Salvage, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_03_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336415","section_number":"4","title":"Ch 4  1838  Lords and Pugilists, \"Penny Gaffs,\" etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_04_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336416","section_number":"5","title":"Ch 5  1838  Thom The Religious Fanatic, His Riots And Death, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_05_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336417","section_number":"6","title":"Ch 6  1838  The Queen's Coronation, The Carriages, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_06_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336418","section_number":"7","title":"Ch 7  1838  Genesis Of The \"Charter,\" London And North-Western Railway, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_07_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336419","section_number":"8","title":"Ch 8  1839  Death Of Lord Norbury, Birth Of Photography, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_08_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336420","section_number":"9","title":"Ch 9  1839  Queen Elizabeth's Statue, The Ladies Of The Bed-chamber, etc","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/gossipvictoria_09_ashton_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336421","section_number":"10","title":"Ch 10  1839  The Eglinton Tournament, Sale Of Armour, etc","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336422","section_number":"11","title":"Ch 11  1839  The Chartists: Their Going To Church, Dissolution Of The Convention, etc","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336423","section_number":"12","title":"Ch 12  1840  Commencement Of Penny Post, Postage Stamps, etc","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336424","section_number":"13","title":"Ch 13  1840  The Mulready Envelope, Plans Of Royal Exchange Decided On, etc","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"336425","section_number":"14","title":"Ch 14  1840  Lord Cardigan And The \"Black Bottle\" Case, Lord Cardigan's Duel With Lieut.
