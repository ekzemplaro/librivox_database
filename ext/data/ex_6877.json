{"books":{"18":{"id":"6877","title":"Orthodox Faith","description":"The Orthodox Faith is the classic epitome of the Early Greek Fathers. Writing just before the last of the truly Ecumenical Councils (787), he remains to this day, the last of the Eastern theologians whole-heartedly received by the West.
