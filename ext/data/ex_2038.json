{"books":{"25":{"id":"2038","title":"Indiscretions of Archie","description":"<br \/>It wasn't Archie's fault really. It's true he went to America and fell in love with Lucille, the daughter of a millionaire hotel proprietor and if he did marry her--well, what else was there to do?<br><\/br>From his point of view, the whole thing was a thoroughly good egg; but Mr. Brewster, his father-in-law, thought differently, Archie had neither money nor occupation, which was distasteful in the eyes of the industrious Mr. Brewster; but the real bar was the fact that he had once adversely criticised one of his hotels. <br><\/br>Archie does his best to heal the breach; but, being something of an ass, genus priceless, he finds it almost beyond his powers to placate \"the man-eating fish\" whom Providence has given him as a father-in-law.
