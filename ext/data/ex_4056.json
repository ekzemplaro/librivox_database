The LibriVox Language Learning Collections contain readings from various language learning books, grammars, primers, phrasebooks, dictionaries, readers and even other works which contain information on various languages, recount experiences of language learning and encountering new languages or provide guides for correct pronunciation, writing or discourse in a language. These works could describe English or any other language whatsoever, from Latin to Sumerian, Chinese to Wampanoag, Esperanto to Swahili (etc.).<br><br>This Volume includes a treatise by Sir Arthur Cotton, author of an \"Arabic Primer\". His daughter, Lady Hope, on page 523 of her biography of her father, writes that he \"had very strong theories on the subject of learning \u201cLiving Languages,\u201d his opinion being that, as every child who comes into the world learns its mother tongue orally, and at first without grammar\u2026 so the learning of all modern languages would be very much facilitated by a similar process.\" Also included are the orientalist E.G. Browne's opinions on language learning (taken from the introduction to A Year Amongst the Persians), the first lesson from Dr. Emil Otto's \"French Conversation-Grammar\", a talk by \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 on the need for a universal auxiliary language, Samuel Johnson's \"A Grammar of the English Tongue\", several sections from Henry Sweet's \"First Steps in Anglo-Saxon\", Lessons 1 - 5 from \"Esperanto in Twenty Lessons\", two sections on language by Varro, a story in Latin from \"Fabulae Faciles\", \"Greek Lessons: 1-10\", the Phonology Section from a \"Primer of Persian\" and Lessons 1 - 19 from \"A Practical Arabic Course\".
