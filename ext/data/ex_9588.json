{"books":{"9":{"id":"9588","title":"People of the Black Circle (version 2)","description":"\"The People of the Black Circle\" is one of the original novellas about Conan the Cimmerian, written by American author Robert E. Howard and first published in Weird Tales magazine in three parts over the September, October and November 1934 issues. Howard earned $250 for the publication of this story.[1]\n\nIt is set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan kidnapping a regal princess of Vendhya (pre-historical India) and foiling a nefarious plot of world domination by the Black Seers of Yimsha. Due to its epic scope and atypical Hindustan flavor, the story is considered an undisputed classic of Conan lore and is often cited by Howard scholars as one of his best tales.[2] It is also one of the few Howard stories where the reader is treated a deeper insight on magic and magicians beyond the stereotypical Hyborian depiction as demon conjurer-illusionist-priests. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/42259","language":"English","copyright_year":"1934","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9588","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"937","first_name":"Robert E.","last_name":"Howard","dob":"1906","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"330484","section_number":"1","title":"Death Strikes a King","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/peopleoftheblackcircle_01_howard_128kbs.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330485","section_number":"2","title":"A Barbarian from the Hills","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330486","section_number":"3","title":"Khemsa Uses Magic","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330487","section_number":"4","title":"An Encounter in the Pass","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330488","section_number":"5","title":"The Black Stallion","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330489","section_number":"6","title":"The Mountain of the Black Seers","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330490","section_number":"7","title":"On to Yimsha","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330491","section_number":"8","title":"Yasmina Knows Stark Terror","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330492","section_number":"9","title":"The Castle of the Wizards","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"330493","section_number":"10","title":"Yasmina and Conan","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"55","name":"Fantasy Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
