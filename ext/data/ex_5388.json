{"books":{"14":{"id":"5388","title":"Light of Egypt Volume II","description":"\"The Light of Egypt\" will be found to be an Occult library in itself, a textbook of esoteric knowledge, setting forth the \"wisdom Religion\" of life, as taught by the Adepts of Hermetic Philosophy. It will richly repay all who are seeking the higher life to carefully study this book, as it contains in a nutshell the wisdom of the ages regarding man and his destiny, here and hereafter. The London and American first edition, also the French edition, Vol. I, met with lively criticism from Blavatsky Theosophists, because it annihilates that agreeable delusion of \"Karma\" and \"Reincarnation\" from the minds of all lovers of truth for truth's sake.\r\n\"The Tablets of Aeth\" is a great and mighty work, as it contains the very quintessence of Occult and Hermetic philosophy, as revealed by spiritual law. \"Penetralia\" is a new revelation, and invaluable to Occult students, as it is the personal experience of a developed soul.
