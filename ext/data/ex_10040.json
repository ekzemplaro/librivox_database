{"books":{"15":{"id":"10040","title":"Lake","description":"Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe) was an American author, poet, editor, and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.\nPoe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2151","language":"English","copyright_year":"1827","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10040","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox\/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-lake-by-edgar-allan-poe\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:23:10","totaltimesecs":1390,"authors":[{"id":"21","first_name":"Edgar Allan","last_name":"Poe","dob":"1809","dod":"1849"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"345032","section_number":"1","title":"The Lake - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thelake_poe_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"98","file_name":"thelake_poe_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"345030","section_number":"2","title":"The Lake - Read by DCC","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thelake_poe_dcc_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"93","file_name":"thelake_poe_dcc_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10038","display_name":"Domenica Campbell"}]},{"id":"345028","section_number":"3","title":"The Lake - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thelake_poe_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"82","file_name":"thelake_poe_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"345025","section_number":"4","title":"The Lake - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thelake_poe_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"80","file_name":"thelake_poe_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"345027","section_number":"5","title":"The Lake - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thelake_poe_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"96","file_name":"thelake_poe_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"345020","section_number":"6","title":"The Lake - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/thelake_poe_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"78","file_name":"thelake_poe_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
