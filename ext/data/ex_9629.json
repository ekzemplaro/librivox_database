{"books":{"34":{"id":"9629","title":"Autobiography of a Super-Tramp","description":"The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp is an autobiography published in 1908 by the Welsh poet and writer W. H. Davies (1871\u20131940). A large part of the book's subject matter describes the way of life of the tramp in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States in the final decade of the 19th century.  George Bernard Shaw had become interested in Davies, a literary unknown at the time, and had agreed to write a preface for the book, largely through the concerted efforts of his wife Charlotte.  Shaw was also instrumental in keeping the unusual title of the book, of which Davies himself was unsure, and which later proved to be controversial with some reviewers.  The book was the third published by Davies, having been preceded by The Soul's Destroyer (1905) and New Poems (1907). The 1920 edition of the book concludes with five poems selected by Davies from The Soul's Destroyer.  The book was written in the space of six weeks, \"a great achievement for a first book by a man with the minimum of education.\" - Summary by Wikipedia (edited by Expatriate)","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/autobiographyas00shawgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"35","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9629","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Autobiography_of_a_Super-Tramp","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2659","first_name":"William Henry","last_name":"Davies","dob":"1871","dod":"1940"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"331715","section_number":"0","title":"Preface by George Bernard Shaw","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/autobiographyofsupertramp_00_davies_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8713","display_name":"Expatriate"}]},{"id":"331716","section_number":"1","title":"I.
