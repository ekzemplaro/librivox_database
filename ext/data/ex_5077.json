{"books":{"14":{"id":"5077","title":"Midnight Passenger","description":"Randall Clayton was surrounded by enemies. His father\u2019s business partner had looked after him in the years since his father\u2019s death. But Hugh Worthington\u2019s motives were not altruistic \u2013 he had a secret to hide and a scheme to bring to fruition that would make him millions at Clayton\u2019s expense. Clayton\u2019s roommate, Arthur Ferris, had his own schemes, including stealing the affections of Worthington\u2019s daughter away from Clayton. Clayton worked for a pittance in New York, where he was watched day and night by Worthington\u2019s spies, and by the ruthless Fritz Braun, who plotted to rob Clayton of the large deposit that he daily carried for his employer. It seemed that Jack Witherspoon was his only friend, the only one he could trust. But Jack was sailing for Europe and neither man fully comprehended the danger that was closing in on Randall.
