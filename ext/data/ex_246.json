As one of the \u201cfathers of realism\u201d Balzac painted with his words a vivid portrait of life in the swirling salons of Europe at the end of the Bourbon monarchy, and we follow Sarrasine from France to Italy in search of both his m\u00e9tier and his muse.\n    However it is also the story of La Zambinella, an Italian singer with whom Sarrasine falls madly and passionately in love. But that passion holds a secret which Sarrasine spies too late.\n    (Summary by Chip)\n\n<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1826","language":"English","copyright_year":"1830","num_sections":"1","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/246","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/sarrasine_librivox\/sarrasine_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sarrasine","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/sarrasine-by-honore-de-balzac\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:39:03","totaltimesecs":5943,"authors":[{"id":"86","first_name":"Honor\u00e9 de","last_name":"Balzac","dob":"1799","dod":"1850"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/sarrasine_librivox","sections":[{"id":"124042","section_number":"1","title":"Sarrasine","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"5943","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"27","name":"Romance"}],"translators":[{"id":"6458","first_name":" Clara","last_name":"Bell","dob":"1835","dod":"1927"}]}]}
