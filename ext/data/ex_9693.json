When the question of government comes up, the little colony chooses a queen, and they work on improving the island for some time, despite internal dissensions, and an attack by savages.  But eventually the colony encounters natural forces it cannot resist, and the queen and her family return to England, hopefully to live \"happily ever after\". - Summary by Alayna May","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/21741","language":"English","copyright_year":"1885","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9693","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/the_island_queen_1505_librivox\/the_island_queen_1505_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-island-queen-by-r-m-ballantyne\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"05:19:06","totaltimesecs":19146,"authors":[{"id":"786","first_name":"R.
