{"books":{"14":{"id":"9351","title":"In Flanders Fields","description":"Librivox volunteers bring you fifteen readings of In Flanders Fields, one of the more famous poems written during the First World War. John McCrae was a poet and physician from Guelph, Ontario. His close friend, Alexis Helmer, was killed during the battle on May 2. McCrae performed the burial service himself, at which time he noted how poppies quickly grew around the graves of those who died at Ypres. The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance.
