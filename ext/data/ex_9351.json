John McCrae was a poet and physician from Guelph, Ontario. His close friend, Alexis Helmer, was killed during the battle on May 2. McCrae performed the burial service himself, at which time he noted how poppies quickly grew around the graves of those who died at Ypres. The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance. - Summary by Summary by Rachel, adapted from Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/353","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9351","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/In_Flanders_Fields","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4131","first_name":" John","last_name":"McCrae","dob":"1872","dod":"1918"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"324248","section_number":"1","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by ADP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_adp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9446","display_name":"AdeledePignerolles"}]},{"id":"324240","section_number":"2","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by JN","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_jn_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5424","display_name":"Julia Niedermaier"}]},{"id":"324241","section_number":"3","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"324246","section_number":"4","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by LB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_lb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9573","display_name":"bean420"}]},{"id":"324245","section_number":"5","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"324243","section_number":"6","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by MAS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_mas_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"324244","section_number":"7","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by RC","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_rc_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9331","display_name":"Rosslyn Carlyle"}]},{"id":"324242","section_number":"8","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by SP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_sp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7356","display_name":"Rachel"}]},{"id":"324247","section_number":"9","title":"In Flanders Fields - Read by WT","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/flandersfields_mccrae_wt_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5694","display_name":"Winston Tharp"}]},{"id":"324249","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324250","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324251","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324252","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324253","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324254","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324255","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324256","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324257","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324258","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"324259","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
