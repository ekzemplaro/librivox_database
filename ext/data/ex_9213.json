{"books":{"11":{"id":"9213","title":"Our Little Austrian Cousin","description":"In this volume I have endeavored to give my young readers a clearer and a more intimate knowledge than is usually possessed of the vast territory known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which is a collection of provinces united under one ruler, and which is, strange to say, the only country of importance in the world that has not a distinctive language of its own, since the various races\u2014German, Slav, Magyar and others\u2014each speak their own tongue. The book is chiefly devoted to Austria proper and Tyrol, but the other provinces, including Dalmatia and Bosnia, are not neglected.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/46230","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9213","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10875","first_name":"Florence E.
