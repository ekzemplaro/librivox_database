{"books":{"36":{"id":"9870","title":"Tarrano the Conqueror","description":"_In \"Tarrano the Conqueror\" is presented a tale of the year 2430 A.D.--a time somewhat farther beyond our present-day era than we are beyond\nColumbus' discovery of America. My desire has been to create for you the impression that you have suddenly been plunged forward into that\ntime--to give you the feeling Columbus might have had could he have read a novel of our present-day life.\n\nTo this end I have conceived myself a writer of that future time, addressing his contemporary public. You are to imagine yourself reading\na present day translation of my original text--a translation so free that a thousand little colloquialisms will have crept into it that could\nnot possibly have their counterparts in the year 2430.\n - Summary by From the author's
