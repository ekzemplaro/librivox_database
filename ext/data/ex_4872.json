This was the Weekly Poetry project for November 7th, 2010.<br \/><br \/>\nThis week's poem has been chosen for this time of remembrance. Lieutenant Ewart Alan Mackintosh M.C. was a war poet and an officer in the Seaforth Highlanders. His best poetry has been said to be comparable in quality to that of Rupert Brooke. In 1916 he led a raid in which several of his men were killed, one of whom inspired this poem. Mackintosh was himself killed on 21 November 1917.
