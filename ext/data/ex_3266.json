{"books":{"4":{"id":"3266","title":"Bible (ASV) 10: 2 Samuel","description":"\u201cThe Books of Samuel (Hebrew: Sefer Sh\u2019muel \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc) are part of the Tanakh (part of Judaism\u2019s Hebrew Bible) and also of the Christian Old Testament. The work was originally written in Hebrew, and the Book(s) of Samuel originally formed a single text, as they are often considered today in Hebrew bibles. Together with what is now referred to as the Book(s) of Kings, the translators who created the Greek Septuagint divided the text into four books, which they named the Books of the Kingdoms. In the Latin Vulgate version, these then became the Books of the Kings, thus 1 and 2 Samuel were referred to as 1 and 2 Kings, with 3 and 4 Kings being what are called 1 and 2 Kings by the King James Bible and its successors.\u201d (Summary by Wikipedia)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/ebible.org\/asv\/2Sam.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1901","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3266","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/bible_2_samuel_asv_1009_ss\/bible_2_samuel_asv_1009_ss_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/second-book-of-samuel\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"2:00:40","totaltimesecs":7240,"authors":[{"id":"187","first_name":"","last_name":"American Standard Version","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/bible_2_samuel_asv_1009_ss","sections":[{"id":"182850","section_number":"1","title":"01 \u2013 Chapters 01-05","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1365","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"182851","section_number":"2","title":" 02 \u2013 Chapters 06-10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1063","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"182852","section_number":"3","title":"03 \u2013 Chapters 11-15","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1770","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"182853","section_number":"4","title":"04 \u2013 Chapters 16-20","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1779","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]},{"id":"182854","section_number":"5","title":"05 \u2013 Chapters 21-24","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1263","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"908","display_name":"Sam Stinson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"79","name":"Bibles"}],"translators":[]}}}
