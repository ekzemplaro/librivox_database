{"books":{"11":{"id":"3400","title":"Lusiads","description":"<p>The Lusiads (Os Lus\u00edadas) is a Portuguese epic poem, written in the 16th century by Luis Vaz de Cam\u00f5es. The poem tells the tale of the Portuguese discoveries in the 15th and 16th centuries, specially the voyage to India by Vasco da Gama. Modelled after the classic epic tradition, Cam\u00f5es' Lusiads are considered not only the first literary text in Modern Portuguese, but also a national epic of the same level as Vergil's Aeneid. In the 19th century, Sir Richard Francis Burton translated Cam\u00f5es' Lusiads, in what he considered \"the most pleasing literary labour of his life\".
