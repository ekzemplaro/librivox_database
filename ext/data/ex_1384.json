{"books":{"17":{"id":"1384","title":"Cruise of the Snark","description":"<p>\nThe Cruise of the Snark (1913) is a memoir of Jack and Charmian London's 1907-1909 voyage across the Pacific. His descriptions of \"surf-riding\", which he dubbed a \"royal sport\", helped introduce it to and popularize it with the mainland. London writes:\n\nThrough the white crest of a breaker suddenly appears a dark figure, erect, a man-fish or a sea-god, on the very forward face of the crest where the top falls over and down, driving in toward shore, buried to his loins in smoking spray, caught up by the sea and flung landward, bodily, a quarter of a mile. It is a Kanaka on a surf-board. And I know that when I have finished these lines I shall be out in that riot of colour and pounding surf, trying to bit those breakers even as he, and failing as he never failed, but living life as the best of us may live it.\n\nExcerpted from Wikipedia. <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2512","language":"English","copyright_year":"1913","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1384","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/cruise_of_the_snark_0902_librivox\/cruise_of_the_snark_0902_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-cruise-of-the-snark-by-jack-london\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:05:39","totaltimesecs":29139,"authors":[{"id":"143","first_name":"Jack","last_name":"London","dob":"1876","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/cruise_of_the_snark_0902_librivox","sections":[{"id":"144004","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I -- Foreword","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1343","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144005","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II -- The Inconceivable And Monstrous","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1891","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144006","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III -- Adventure","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1045","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144007","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV -- Finding One's Way About","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1392","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144008","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter V -- The First Landfall","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"911","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144009","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter VI -- A Royal Sport","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1460","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144010","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter VII -- The Lepers Of Molokai","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1842","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144011","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter VIII -- The House Of The Sun","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1746","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144012","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter IX -- A Pacific Traverse","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2149","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144013","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter X -- Typee","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1851","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144014","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XI -- The Nature Man","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1669","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1743","display_name":"Bryan Ness"}]},{"id":"144015","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter XII -- The High Seat of Abundance","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2309","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3448","display_name":"Todd Lennon"}]},{"id":"144016","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter XIII -- The Stone-fishing of Bora Bora","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"915","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3449","display_name":"Pam Burton"}]},{"id":"144017","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter XIV -- The Amateur Navigator","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2405","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"144018","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter XV -- Cruising in the Solomons","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2325","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3368","display_name":"Jim Allman"}]},{"id":"144019","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter XVI -- Beche de Mer English","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"939","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3446","display_name":"kayo"}]},{"id":"144020","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter XVII -- The Amateur M.D.","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2343","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3448","display_name":"Todd Lennon"}]},{"id":"144021","section_number":"18","title":"Back Word","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"604","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3446","display_name":"kayo"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"111","name":"Memoirs"}],"translators":[]}}}
