{"books":{"5":{"id":"8226","title":"World That Couldn't Be (Version 2)","description":"The planet where his new plantation was established was very strange, with a complete lack of sex; all of his workers and all the animals and plants had no sex at all; they were all 'its'.    But like every farmer on every planet, Duncan had to hunt down anything that damaged his crops\u2014and whatever animal ate his vua plants was going to die.  Of course he had no idea what this one looked like or what it was like, but whatever it was, he would track it and his rifle would bring it down.  It was a very interesting hunt with a very interesting ending.  Simak has written another delightful story that will keep you listening and wondering to the very end.  With maybe a chuckle and guffaw on top.   Listen and find out why.
