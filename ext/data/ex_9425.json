Doyle wrote four novels and 56 stories starring the fictional detective.<\/p>\nThe story is set in 1888.[citation needed] The Sign of the Four has a complex plot involving service in East India Company, India, the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a stolen treasure, and a secret pact among four convicts (\"the Four\" of the title) and two corrupt prison guards. It presents the detective's drug habit and humanizes him in a way that had not been done in the preceding novel A Study in Scarlet (1887). It also introduces Doctor Watson's future wife, Mary Morstan. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2097","language":"English","copyright_year":"1890","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9425","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Sign_of_the_Four","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"467","first_name":"Sir Arthur Conan","last_name":"Doyle","dob":"1859","dod":"1930"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"326311","section_number":"1","title":"The Science of Deduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/signofthefour_01_doyle.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326312","section_number":"2","title":"The Statement of the Case","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/signofthefour_02_doyle.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326313","section_number":"3","title":"In Quest of A Solution","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/signofthefour_03_doyle.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326314","section_number":"4","title":"The Story of the Bald-Headed Man","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/signofthefour_04_doyle.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326315","section_number":"5","title":"The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/signofthefour_05_doyle.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326316","section_number":"6","title":"Sherlock Holmes Gives A Demonstration","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/signofthefour_06_doyle.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326317","section_number":"7","title":"The Episode of the Barrel","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/dlolso21\/signofthefour_07_doyle.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326318","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326319","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326320","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326321","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"326322","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"3","name":"Action & Adventure Fiction"},{"id":"22","name":"Detective Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
