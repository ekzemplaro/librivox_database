{"books":{"7":{"id":"6302","title":"Old Times on the Mississippi","description":"Old Times on the Mississippi is a non-fiction work by Mark Twain. It was published in 1876. Originally published in serial form in the Atlantic Monthly, in 1875, this same work was published as chapters 4 through 17 in Twain's later work, Life on the Mississippi (1883). Old Times on the the Mississippi has one last chapter that has nothing to do with the rest of the book. A Literary Nightmare describes the funny\/sad\/maddening effect that a catchy jingle can have on those unlucky enough to be captured by one.
