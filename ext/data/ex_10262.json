{"books":{"38":{"id":"10262","title":"Doctor Syn","description":"Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh is the first in the series of Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike and inspired a Disney movie called the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh starring Patrick Patrick McGoohan. In this story we are introduced to the complex Christopher Syn, the kindly vicar of the little town of Dymchurch. Dr Syn seems pleasant, but is he much more than he seems?  Although published first, this book is the last of the series chronologically. The town is located near the Romney Marsh, an ideal location for smuggling operations.  Captain Howard Collyer, a revenue agent for the crown, arrives on the scene convinced that he can find and capture the smugglers that must be active in the area.  The locals deny any knowledge of any smuggling operations, but warn of mysterious bands of witches and glowing demons that ride fire-breathing horses roam the marsh.  Can this straight forward navy captain survive these supernatural foes as he investigates Romney Marsh and the disturbing events that begin to happen in Dymchurch?  - Summary by Brett Downey","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/doctorsynsmuggle00thor","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"39","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10262","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doctor_Syn:_A_Tale_of_the_Romney_Marsh","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11597","first_name":"Russell","last_name":"Thorndike","dob":"1885","dod":"1972"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"351556","section_number":"1","title":"Dymchurch-under-the-wall","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/doctorsyn_01_thorndike_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4535","display_name":"Brett W.
