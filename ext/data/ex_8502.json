{"books":{"11":{"id":"8502","title":"Around the Wicket Gate","description":"Millions of men are in the outlying regions, far off from God and peace; for these we pray, and to these we give warning.  But just now we have to do with a smaller company, who are not far from the kingdom, but have come right up to the wicket gate which stands at the head of the way of life.  One would think that they would hasten to enter, for a free and open invitation is placed over the entrance, the porter waits to welcome them, and there is but this one way to eternal life.  He that is most loaded seems the most likely to pass in and begin the heavenward journey; but what ails the other men? <\/br> <\/br> He who does not take this step of faith, and so enter upon the road to heaven, will perish.  It will be an awful ting to die just outside the gate of life.  Almost saved, but altogether lost!  A man just outside Noah's ark would be drowned; a manslayer just outside the wall of the city of refuge would be slain; and the man who is within a yard of Christ, and yet has not trusted hi, will be lost.  Therefore am I in terrible earnest to get my hesitating friends over the threshold.  <i>Come in! Come in!<\/i> is my pressing entreaty.  May the Holy Spirit render it effectual with many who shall glance at these pages!  May he cause his own almighty voice to be heard creating faith at once!  <br\/><br\/>To God this book is commended; for without his grace nothing will come of all that is written.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=pL3UAAAAMAAJ","language":"English","copyright_year":"1890","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8502","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/aroundthewicketgate_1312_librivox\/aroundthewicketgate_1312_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/around-the-wicket-gate-by-charles-h-spurgeon\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:08:32","totaltimesecs":7712,"authors":[{"id":"1490","first_name":"Charles H.","last_name":"Spurgeon","dob":"1834","dod":"1892"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/aroundthewicketgate_1312_librivox","sections":[{"id":"301493","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_00_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"296","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_00_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301494","section_number":"1","title":"Awakening","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_01_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"546","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_01_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301495","section_number":"2","title":"Jesus Only","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_02_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"628","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_02_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301496","section_number":"3","title":"Faith in the Person of the Lord Jesus","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_03_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"889","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_03_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301497","section_number":"4","title":"Faith very Simple","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_04_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"943","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_04_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301498","section_number":"5","title":"Fearing to Believe","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_05_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"684","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_05_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301499","section_number":"6","title":"Difficulty in the Way of Believing","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_06_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"613","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_06_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301500","section_number":"7","title":"A Helpful Survey of Christ's Work","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_07_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"743","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_07_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301501","section_number":"8","title":"A Real Hinderance to Faith","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_08_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"548","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_08_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301502","section_number":"9","title":"On Raising Questions","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_09_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"535","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_09_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301503","section_number":"10","title":"Without Faith no Salvation","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_10_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"420","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_10_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]},{"id":"301504","section_number":"11","title":"To those who have Believed","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/maryannspiegel\/aroundwicketgate_11_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"867","file_name":"aroundwicketgate_11_spurgeon_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnn"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"130","name":"Christianity - Other"}],"translators":[]}}}
