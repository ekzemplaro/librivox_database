L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis is regarded as the Latvian national epic.\n\nThe poem recounts the life of the legendary hero L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis, chosen by the gods to become a hero of his people. His name means \"Bear-slayer\u201d. At the castle of Lord Aizkrauklis, he spies on the activities of the witch Sp\u012bdola(Sp\u012bdala), who is under the control of the Devil, and the holy man Kangars, who is in reality a traitor plotting to replace the old gods with Christianity. L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis meets and falls in love with the maiden Laimdota and becomes friends with another hero, Koknesis (\"Wood-bearer\").\nFurther adventures seperate the lovers and bring Laimdota to Germany, but L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis becomes lost in the Northern Sea, where he is welcomed by the daughter of the North Wind. In his dangerous journey home from the Northern Sea, he fights monsters and is reunited with Laimdota. They return home and celebrate wedding, but the heroes soon set off to fight the German crusaders. Kangars finds out the secret of L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis' strength and treacherously reveals it to the Germans. In a seemingly friendly tournament L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis is overpowered by the Black Knight, they both fall into Daugava river and disappear.\n(Summary adapted from Wikipedia by Kristine Bekere)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.ailab.lv\/teksti\/Senie\/Pumpurs\/lacsat.htm","language":"Latvian","copyright_year":"1988","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2022","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/lacplesis_kb_librivox\/lacplesis_kb_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/lacplesis-by-andrejs-pumpurs\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:25:41","totaltimesecs":12341,"authors":[{"id":"4753","first_name":" Andrejs","last_name":"Pumpurs","dob":"1841","dod":"1902"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/lacplesis_kb_librivox","sections":[{"id":"157022","section_number":"1","title":"I dzied\u0101jums","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"584","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157023","section_number":"2","title":"II dzied\u0101jums","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2503","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157024","section_number":"3","title":"III dzied\u0101jums, I da\u013ca","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1618","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157025","section_number":"4","title":"III dzied\u0101jums, II da\u013ca","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1911","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157026","section_number":"5","title":"IV dzied\u0101jums, I da\u013ca","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"930","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157027","section_number":"6","title":"IV dzied\u0101jums, II da\u013ca","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1074","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157028","section_number":"7","title":"V dzied\u0101jums","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1420","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157029","section_number":"8","title":"VI dzied\u0101jums, I da\u013ca","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1073","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]},{"id":"157030","section_number":"9","title":"VI dzied\u0101jums, II da\u013ca","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1228","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1593","display_name":"Kristine Bekere"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"}],"translators":[]}}}
