{"books":{"41":{"id":"9882","title":"Defeat of Youth and Other Poems","description":"Though later known for his essays and novels, Aldous Huxley started his writing career as a poet. Published in 1918, The Defeat of Youth and Other Poems is his third compilation of poetry. <br><br>The volume begins with \"The Defeat of Youth\", a sequence of twenty-two sonnets that explores irreconcilability of the ideal and the disappointing reality. Jerome Meckier called it \u201cthe century\u2019s most successful sonnet sequence, better than Auden\u2019s or Edna St. Vincent Millay\u2019s.\u201d In the rest of the volume, Huxley continues to explore themes started in The Burning Wheel, his first volume of poetry, including vision, blindness, and other contrasts. <br><br>The volume concludes with two English translations by Huxley of two French poems: St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s 1876 poem \u201cL\u2019Apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune\" and Arthur Rimbaud\u2019s (1871) poem \u201cLes Chercheuses de poux,\u201d translated as \u201cThe Louse Hunters.\u201d  Summary by Mary Kay.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/24364","language":"English","copyright_year":"1918","num_sections":"42","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9882","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1538","first_name":"Aldous","last_name":"Huxley","dob":"1894","dod":"1963"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"340346","section_number":"1","title":"The
