{"books":{"8":{"id":"2445","title":"Cattle-Raid of Cualnge (Tain Bo Cualnge) : An Old Irish Prose-Epic","description":"<p>T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge (\"the driving-off of cows of Cooley\", more usually rendered The Cattle Raid of Cooley or The T\u00e1in) is the central tale in the Ulster Cycle, one of the four great cycles that make up the surviving corpus of Irish mythology. It is written in Old and Middle Irish, mainly in prose, with some verse sections, especially at moments of heightened tension or emotion. The tale relates a war against Ulster by the Connacht queen Medb and her husband Ailill, who intend to steal the stud bull Donn Cuailnge, and the efforts of the teenage Ulster hero C\u00fachulainn to oppose them.
