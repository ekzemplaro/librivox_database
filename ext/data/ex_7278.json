{"books":{"17":{"id":"7278","title":"Cranford (version 2)","description":"<p>Cranford is set in a small market town populated largely by a number of respectable ladies. It tells of their secrets and foibles, their gossip and their romances as they face the challenges of dealing with new inhabitants to their society and innovations to their settled existence. It was first published between 1851 and 1853 as episodes in Charles Dickens\u2019 Journal Household Words. Appended to this recording is a short sequel, The Cage at Cranford, written ten years later and published in the journal All the Year Round. In a letter to Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte wrote: \u201cThank you for your letter, it was as pleasant as a quiet chat, as welcome as spring showers, as reviving as a friend\u2019s visit; in short, it was very like a page of Cranford.\u201d... Cranford is a genteel and humorous look at Victorian society by Elizabeth Gaskell, and is quite a change from her more gritty novels like Mary Barton or North and South.
