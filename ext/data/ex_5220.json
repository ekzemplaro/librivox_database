{"books":{"21":{"id":"5220","title":"Minor Works of Josephus","description":"There are 3 parts to this collection.<br\/><br\/>\n\n(1) <i>Against Apion<\/i> is a two-volume defence of Judaism as classical religion and philosophy, stressing its antiquity, as opposed to what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent tradition of the Greeks. Some anti-Judean allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer Apion, and myths accredited to Manetho are also addressed.<br\/><br\/>\n\n(2) <i>Discourse To The Greeks Concerning Hades <\/i>describes the author's views on the afterlife against the prevailing view of the \"Greeks\" (i.e., the Greco-Romans) of his day. Although generally still reprinted in editions of Whiston's <i>Josephus<\/i>, later scholars have realized that this attribution is incorrect. This brief discourse, at least in its original form, is now attributed to the church father Hippolytus.<br\/><br\/>\n\n(3) <i>The Life of Josephus<\/i> is an autobiographical text written by Josephus in approximately 94-99 CE \u2013 possibly as an appendix to his <i>Antiquities of the Jews<\/i> \u2013 where the author for the most part re-visits the events of the War, apparently in response to allegations made against him by Justus of Tiberias.
