After graduating from high school, Cawein worked in a pool hall in Louisville as a cashier in Waddill's New-market, which also served as a gambling house. He worked there for six years, saving his pay so he could return home to write.\nHis output was thirty-six books and 1,500 poems. His writing presented Kentucky scenes in a language echoing Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats. He soon earned the nickname the \"Keats of Kentucky\".\n\nNote: In Greek mythology, Hippocrene was the name of a spring on Mt. Helicon. It was sacred to the Muses and was formed by the hooves of Pegasus. Its name literally translates as \"Horse's Fountain\" and the water was supposed to bring forth poetic inspiration when imbibed. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/34027","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9949","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"22","first_name":"Madison","last_name":"Cawein","dob":"1865","dod":"1914"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"342342","section_number":"1","title":"Don Quixote - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"342343","section_number":"2","title":"Don Quixote - Read by BMS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_bms_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"76","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_bms_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10071","display_name":"Beth Sullivan"}]},{"id":"342344","section_number":"3","title":"Don Quixote - Read by CB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_cb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_cb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9862","display_name":"Caitlin Buckley"}]},{"id":"342353","section_number":"4","title":"Don Quixote - Read by CLP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_clp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"65","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_clp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9642","display_name":"Chris Pyle"}]},{"id":"342355","section_number":"5","title":"Don Quixote - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"72","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"342348","section_number":"6","title":"Don Quixote - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"71","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"342354","section_number":"7","title":"Don Quixote - Read by FS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_fs_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"77","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_fs_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6735","display_name":"fshort"}]},{"id":"342347","section_number":"8","title":"Don Quixote - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"88","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"342345","section_number":"9","title":"Don Quixote - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/donquixote_cawein_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"72","file_name":"donquixote_cawein_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
