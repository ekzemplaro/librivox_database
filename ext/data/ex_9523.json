{"books":{"6":{"id":"9523","title":"Canterville Ghost (version 2)","description":"A modern American family move into a traditionally drafty and very haunted English mansion. So far so good but anyone knowing Wilde can expect twists and turns to make it interesting. In this cast the crusty old ghost has a tough time convincing the family he exists and then in frightening them. This is extremely frustrating of course to him and as the protagonist of the story, takes matters (and non-matters) into his hands to deal with the upstart and irreverent new tenants.
