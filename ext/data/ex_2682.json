{"books":{"19":{"id":"2682","title":"Captain Jim","description":"This book is about Norah Linton, her brother Jim, her father David and Jim's chum Wally from Australia. They all move to England during WWI because Jim and Wally want to fight in the war.<br \/><br \/>When a Irish friend of the family dies, Norah inherits a big house in Surrey: Homewood. To keep up the Irishman's memory they want to use the house to help the war effort. They turn it into a home for \"Tired People\"--soldiers recovering from injuries, or soldiers on leave that have no family to go home to, can come here to have a good time and enjoy the country-side, so that they can go back to their regiments fully rested and restored.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately Jim and Wally are soon called upon to fight, leaving Norah and her father to take care of the Tired People.
