{"books":[{"id":"405","title":"Romance of Rubber","description":"<p>This pamphlet was published in the early 20th century by the United States Rubber Company so that \"coming generations of our country ... have some understanding of the importance of rubber in our every day life... We believe the rubber industry will be better off if the future citizens of our country know more about it.\" Learn about Christopher Columbus's discovery of rubber, how the crafty British entrepreneur, Wickham, managed to smuggle rubber seedlings out of Brazil, and how rubber manufacturing came to be a \"peculiarly American industry.\" The myriad uses of rubber from a century ago are also elaborated in considerable detail - everything from submarines to Keds to dentures.
