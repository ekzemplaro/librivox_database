{"books":[{"id":"327","title":"Bible (KJV) NT 20: James","description":"The writer of this letter instructs the early Christians on the value of showing patience, controlling an unruly tongue and treating all people with kindness without respect to their social position. It also provides the basis for the practice of blessing the sick with an anointing of oil. The book has been historically controversial because of its teaching that both faith and works are necessary to salvation. The great promise in the book is that those who are honestly seeking wisdom may receive it by asking for divine help.
