{"books":{"22":{"id":"9439","title":"In God's Way","description":"Bj\u00f6rnstjerne Bj\u00f6rnson's 1889 book In God's Way was translated almost immediately by Elizabeth Carmichael and was included in Edmund Gosse's first volume of Heinemann's International Library. Gosse said, \"In God's Way, which was originally published in 1889, has been universally received as the most remarkable. It is a book which combines the romantic colour and ideal glow of the author's early pastoral stories, with a deeper insight into life and a graver examination of the relations of impulse to duty.\" His book divides the life of his character into three stages much like Soren Kierkegaard did in his books Either\/Or and Stages On Life's Way. Kierkegaard would have them 1. esthetic 2. ethical 3. religious and Bj\u00f6rnson into 1. schooldays 2. youth 3. manhood. S\u00f6ren Kierkegaard's father was Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard and Bj\u00f6rnson names his character S\u00f6ren Pedersen. Bj\u00f6rnson was from Norway. - Summary by Craig Campbell","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/37726","language":"English","copyright_year":"1890","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9439","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2790","first_name":"Bj\u00f8rnstjerne","last_name":"Bj\u00f8rnson","dob":"1832","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"326589","section_number":"0","title":"Editors note through Introduction","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"326590","section_number":"1","title":"School Days Part I","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"326591","section_number":"2","title":"School Days Part II","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"326592","section_number":"3","title":"School Days Part III","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"326593","section_number":"4","title":"Youth Part I First Couple Forward","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326594","section_number":"5","title":"Youth Part II Next Couple Forward Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326595","section_number":"6","title":"Youth Part II Next Couple Forward Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326596","section_number":"7","title":"Youth Part II Next Couple Forward Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326597","section_number":"8","title":"Youth Part II Next Couple Forward Part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326598","section_number":"9","title":"Manhood Part I","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326599","section_number":"10","title":"Manhood Part II","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326600","section_number":"11","title":"Manhood Part III","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326601","section_number":"12","title":"Manhood Part IV","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326602","section_number":"13","title":"Manhood Part V","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326603","section_number":"14","title":"Manhood Part VI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326604","section_number":"15","title":"Manhood Part VII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326605","section_number":"16","title":"Manhood Part VIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326606","section_number":"17","title":"Manhood Part IX","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326607","section_number":"18","title":"Manhood Part X A","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326608","section_number":"19","title":"Manhood Part X B","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326609","section_number":"20","title":"Manhood Part XI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326610","section_number":"21","title":"Manhood Part XII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"326611","section_number":"22","title":"Manhood Part XIII","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"6","name":"Culture & Heritage"}],"translators":[{"id":"11022","first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Carmichael","dob":"unk","dod":"unk"}]}}}
