{"books":{"2":{"id":"8840","title":"Biography of a Grizzly","description":"Wahb (meaning White Bear) is an orphaned Grizzly Bear who learns to respect his fears, fight for peace, and trust the healing powers of a stinky hot-spring. The story is aptly titled The Biography of a Grizzly because it is about the life of a Grizzly. \nSeton writes with a folksy tone that will enlighten children to the gore and war that Grizzly Bears endure. I thought it was fun to learn (through Wahb's story) about their life span, their diet, their ability to survive gunshots and bear-traps. Beautifully written, the author captures each moment in a way that you almost feel as though you're in the story. If a bear had the ability to write his story, in short, a legacy, this would surely be one that \"bears\" repeating (phil chenevert and wikipedia )<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/25023","language":"English","copyright_year":"1900","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8840","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/thebiographyofagrizzly_1404_librivox\/thebiographyofagrizzly_1404_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-biography-of-a-grizzly-by-ernest-thompson-seton\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:35:54","totaltimesecs":5754,"authors":[{"id":"634","first_name":"Ernest Thompson","last_name":"Seton","dob":"1860","dod":"1946"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/thebiographyofagrizzly_1404_librivox","sections":[{"id":"310258","section_number":"1","title":"PART I THE CUBHOOD OF WAHB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/biographyofagrizzly_01_seton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2104","file_name":"thebiographyofagrizzly_01_seton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"310259","section_number":"2","title":"PART II THE DAYS OF HIS STRENGTH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/biographyofagrizzly_02_seton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1774","file_name":"thebiographyofagrizzly_02_seton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"310260","section_number":"3","title":"PART III THE WANING","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/biographyofagrizzly_03_seton.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1876","file_name":"thebiographyofagrizzly_03_seton_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"38","name":"Animals & Nature"}],"translators":[]}}}
