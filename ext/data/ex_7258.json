{"books":{"21":{"id":"7258","title":"In a Steamer Chair and Other Stories","description":"Thirteen short stories by one of the most famous writers in his day. Robert Barr was a British Canadian short story writer and novelist, born in Glasgow, Scotland. In London of the 1890s Barr became a more prolific author - publishing a book a year - and was familiar with many of the best selling authors of his day, including Bret Harte and Stephen Crane. Most of his literary output was of the crime genre, then quite in vogue. When Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories were becoming well known, Barr published in the Idler the first Holmes parody, \"The Adventures of Sherlaw Kombs\" (1892), a spoof that was continued a decade later in another Barr story, \"The Adventure of the Second Swag\" (1904)(For these two stories, see in LibriVox Barr's <i>The Triumphs of Eug\u00e8ne Valmont<\/i>). Despite the jibe at the growing Holmes phenomenon Barr and Doyle remained on very good terms. Doyle describes him in his memoirs <i>Memories and Adventures<\/i> as, \"a volcanic Anglo - or rather Scot American, with a violent manner, a wealth of strong adjectives, and one of the kindest natures underneath it all.\" (Summary by Wikipedia and David Wales)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/9309","language":"English","copyright_year":"1892","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7258","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/steamerchair_dw_librivox\/steamerchair_dw_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/in-a-steamer-chair-and-other-stories-by-robert-barr\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:37:29","totaltimesecs":23849,"authors":[{"id":"811","first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Barr","dob":"1849","dod":"1912"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/steamerchair_dw_librivox","sections":[{"id":"110831","section_number":"0","title":"00
