{"books":{"4":{"id":"8941","title":"Life and Death, and Other Stories and Legends","description":"Henryk Sienkiewicz won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905, but as he wrote in Polish many English-speakers are unfamiliar with his work. This short story collection is a sampler of five myths and legends which he collected. The \"Life and Death\" of the title is a Hindu legend, the rest of Polish stories. All are short and together form a little taste of this great author who is too often unknown to English readers. - Summary by Beth Thomas","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/35736","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8941","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox\/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/life-and-death-and-other-stories-and-legends-by-henryk-sienkiewicz\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:37:56","totaltimesecs":2276,"authors":[{"id":"1966","first_name":"Henryk","last_name":"Sienkiewicz","dob":"1846","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox","sections":[{"id":"313306","section_number":"1","title":"Life and Death","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/lifeanddeath_01_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"629","file_name":"lifeanddeath_01_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9311","display_name":"Ivory Ballard"}]},{"id":"313307","section_number":"2","title":"Is He the Dearest One?","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/lifeanddeath_02_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"203","file_name":"lifeanddeath_02_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9311","display_name":"Ivory Ballard"}]},{"id":"313308","section_number":"3","title":"A Legend of the Sea","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/lifeanddeath_03_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"399","file_name":"lifeanddeath_03_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4511","display_name":"Jeanie"}]},{"id":"313309","section_number":"4","title":"The Cranes","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/lifeanddeath_04_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"541","file_name":"lifeanddeath_04_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5694","display_name":"Winston Tharp"}]},{"id":"313310","section_number":"5","title":"The Judgement of Peter and Paul on Olympus","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/triciag\/lifeanddeath_05_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"504","file_name":"lifeanddeath_05_sienkiewicz_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9311","display_name":"Ivory Ballard"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"11","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[{"id":"7075","first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"Curtin","dob":"1835","dod":"1906"}]}}}
