{"books":{"12":{"id":"7853","title":"Double:  A Petersburg Poem","description":"This is the story of a mild-mannered civil servant, Mr. Golyadkin, who begins to see his \"doppelganger\" appearing in his life (at work, in society, etc). This \"double\" has all the qualities that the protagonist lacks. His \"double\" bullies and persecutes him, slowly taking his place in the world. As the story progresses what could have been a true \"double\" is revealed to the reader as being Mr. Golyadkin's own mind splitting from reality. It is a haunting and tragic tale.
