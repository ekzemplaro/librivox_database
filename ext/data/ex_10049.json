{"books":{"27":{"id":"10049","title":"Will and No Will or a Bone for the Lawyers","description":"This \"Afterpiece\"  - a short play to follow a main production - was first produced in 1746. It was based on Regnard's five-act comedy le Legetaire Universel (1707), which is itself a composite of Italian comedy with echoes of Moli\u00e8re, moving from scene to scene with little effort at logical consistency or structure but treating each scene autonomously for its own comic value.  \n\nThe rather long Prologue to A WILL AND NO WILL (11 pages of manuscript) makes fun of the convention of the eighteenth century prologues by the familiar dodge of having two actors chatting as though they were in the Pit waiting for the actors in the main play to dress for the afterpiece. -
