{"books":{"30":{"id":"2337","title":"History of Florence and of the Affairs of Italy, Vol. 1","description":"<p>History of Florence and of the Affairs of Italy is an historical account by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. Toward the end of 1520, the Cardinal Giulio of Medici, later Pope Clement VII, offered Machiavelli the appointment to write a history of Florence. Although Machiavelli was reluctant to accept, accepting was his only way to regain the good graces of the Medici who had regained power and were in a position to offer him employment and protection. Doing the history also provided a way for Machiavelli\u2019s views to become the \u201cofficial\u201d history of Florentine and Italian affairs. Once completed, the work was presented officially to Giulio, now Pope, in May of 1526.
