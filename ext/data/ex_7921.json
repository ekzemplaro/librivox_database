{"books":{"14":{"id":"7921","title":"Recollections of Bush life in Australia","description":"This was written in the mid 1800\u2019s at time when Australia saw an influx of immigration from Europe and when England was sending some prisoners to Australia rather than to prisons. Haygarth shows us what it is like, and what it takes, to live in the Australian Bush. He shows us about the different life on a cattle\/sheep station, living miles from the nearest neighbor, getting to town just a few times a year and that it may be several hundred miles away. From his own experiences relates dealings with BushRangers (thieves), building and running a station, breaking wild horses, helping neighbors in times of need. We learn about how disputes are settled, the wildlife and fauna of the bush, aboriginal customs, festivals and weapons.
