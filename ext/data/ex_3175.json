{"books":{"24":{"id":"3175","title":"Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects Vol 1","description":"<p>The Lives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, from Cimabue to Our Times, or Le Vite delle pi\u00f9 eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori, as it was originally known in Italian, is a series of artist biographies written by 16th century Italian painter and architect Giorgio Vasari, which is considered \"perhaps the most famous, and even today the most- read work of the older literature of art\", \"some of the Italian Renaissance's most influential writing on art\", and \"one of the founding texts in art history\".\n\nVasari's work has been described as \"by far the most influential single text for the history of Renaissance art\" and \"the most important work of Renaissance biography of artists\". Its influence is situated mainly in three domains: as an example for contemporary and later biographers and art historians, as a defining factor in the view on the Renaissance and the role of Florence and Rome in it, and as a major source of information on the lives and works of early Italian artists.\n\n(Summary by
