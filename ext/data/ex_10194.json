{"books":{"81":{"id":"10194","title":"Helen of Troy and Other Poems","description":"Sara Teasdale was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where she attended a school that was founded by the grandfather of another great poet from St. Louis\u2014T. S. Eliot. She later associated herself more with New York City. Her first book of poems was \"Sonnets to Duse\" (1907), but \"Helen of Troy\" (1911) was the true launch of her career, followed by \"Rivers to the Sea\" (1915), \"Love Songs\" (1917), \"Flame and Shadow\" (1920) and more. Her final volume, \"Strange Victory\", is considered by many to be predictive of her suicide.<br><\/br>It is interesting to note that in Teasdale's Collected Works, about half of the poems in this volume\u2014some more justly than others\u2014have been excluded, and most of the rest have been slightly changed. Most of the poems from this volume which were selected to be included in \"Love Songs\" also had some minor changes. This edition preserves the original readings, but they are not to be considered authoritative. - Summary by the
