{"books":{"51":{"id":"4138","title":"Greek View of Life","description":"<p><i>\u201cWith the Greek civilisation beauty perished from the world. Never again has it been possible for man to believe that harmony is in fact the truth of all existence.\u201d<\/i><br\/><br\/>\n\nThis elegantly-written work provides a splendid introduction to the Greeks of the classic period: how they thought, wrote, and organised their lives and loves.  Although it dates from the 1890s, there is very little about it that has dated.  To its author\u2019s credit, the subject of \u201cGreek love\u201d is dealt with in a sane and factual context - despite the judicial assassination of Oscar Wilde going on in the background.<br\/><br\/>\n\nA Cambridge don much admired by his students (including  E. M. Forster), Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson belonged to the Apostles, a secret society with a strong ethic of male friendship.  Alfred Tennyson and his beloved Arthur Hallam were early members.  Dickinson is chiefly remembered as a historian and pacifist who played a significant part in the founding of the League of Nations.  Inevitably, given his interests and intellectual background, he became a close associate of the Bloomsbury Group.   <br\/><br\/>\n   \n<i>The Greek View of Life<\/i> is no dry academic tome.   It is a popularizing work in the best sense: accessibly written and illustrated with apt quotations given in sturdy translations, never in the original Greek.  It is a joy to read.<br\/>\n (Introduction by Martin Geeson)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/6200","language":"English","copyright_year":"1909","num_sections":"52","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4138","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/greek_view_life_mg_librivox\/greek_view_life_mg_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-greek-view-of-life-by-goldsworthy-lowes-dickinson\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"10:55:53","totaltimesecs":39353,"authors":[{"id":"724","first_name":"Goldsworthy Lowes","last_name":"Dickinson","dob":"1862","dod":"1932"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/greek_view_life_mg_librivox","sections":[{"id":"30337","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapter I: The Greek View of Religion.
