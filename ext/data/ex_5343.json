{"books":{"29":{"id":"5343","title":"Rachel Ray","description":"The love that develops between Luke Rowan and Rachel Ray is not universally welcomed. Mrs. Tappitt- a rich, influential, and bad woman - wishes him to marry one of her own daughters, while Rachel's mother and older sister are not sure he is worthy of her. After many adventures, everybody gets what they deserve. Characteristically to Trollope's works, there is also a secondary plot involving the election of parliament in Baslehurst.\"<br>Summary by Stav Nisser.\r\n\r\nThe book lives still because of its delicate little scenes of comedy, the meeting of the lovers, Mrs. Tappitt's ball, the bedroom confidences of the Tappitts, Rachel's talks with her mother. -Walpole","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/34000","language":"English","copyright_year":"1863","num_sections":"30","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5343","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/rachel_ray_1105\/rachel_ray_1105_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rachel-ray-by-anthony-trollope\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"13:55:31","totaltimesecs":50131,"authors":[{"id":"513","first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Trollope","dob":"1815","dod":"1882"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/rachel_ray_1105","sections":[{"id":"62319","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
