It was intended as a manual for beginners and a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God's creation, Man, Man's purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God. (Summary adapted from the Wikipedia)<br><br>\n\nThis selection of the Summa Theologica covers questions 49-89 of the Prima Secundae (\"First-half of the Second Part\"), a Treatise on the Habits, Virtues and Vices: the habits in general (questions 49-54), and in particular (questions 55-89), whether expressed as virtues (55-70) or as vices (71-89).","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/17897","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"41","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9616","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1199","first_name":"Saint Thomas","last_name":"Aquinas","dob":"1225","dod":"1274"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"331257","section_number":"1","title":"Question 49 - OF HABITS IN GENERAL, AS TO THEIR SUBSTANCE (In Four Articles)","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9819","display_name":"M.S.C.
