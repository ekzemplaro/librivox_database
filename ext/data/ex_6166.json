{"books":{"20":{"id":"6166","title":"John Dene of Toronto; a Comedy of Whitehall","description":"John Dene comes to England with a great invention, and the intention of gingering-up the Admiralty. His directness and unconventional methods bewilder and embarrass the officials at Whitehall, where, according to him, most of the jobs are held by those \"whose great-grandfathers had a pleasant way of saying how-do-you-do to a prince.\"<br\/><br\/>\n\nSuddenly John Dene disappears, and the whole civilised world is amazed at an offer of \u00a320,000 for news of him. Scotland Yard is disorganised by tons of letters and thousands of callers. Questions are asked in the House, the Government becomes anxious, only Department Z. retains its equanimity.<br\/><br\/>\n\nBy the way, what did happen to John Dene of Toronto?<br\/>\n(Introduction by Author)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/33277","language":"English","copyright_year":"1920","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6166","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/john_dene_1203_librivox\/john_dene_1203_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/john-dene-of-toronto-by-herbert-george-jenkins\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:54:53","totaltimesecs":28493,"authors":[{"id":"853","first_name":"Herbert George","last_name":"Jenkins","dob":"1876","dod":"1923"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/john_dene_1203_librivox","sections":[{"id":"84111","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
