{"books":{"14":{"id":"8693","title":"Isle in the Water","description":"'Here, among the hosts of ladies who write with care and inelegance, comes a woman artist. \"An Isle in the Water\" is a collection of fifteen well-conceived and excellently-finished Irish stories, for which it would be hard to find anything to say but praise. They are all extremely short for the force of their effect, and every touch tells; they are gracefully phrased without an appearance of artifice, subtly expressed without a suspicion of affectation.' -- Saturday Review, 1897","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/31391","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8693","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"8252","first_name":"Katharine Tynan","last_name":"Hinkson","dob":"1859","dod":"1931"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"306457","section_number":"1","title":"The First Wife","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6408","display_name":"Elise C.
