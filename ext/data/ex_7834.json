{"books":{"9":{"id":"7834","title":"Our Little Korean Cousin","description":"This book is one of a series that aims at describing other cultures to children in an entertaining way that honors the culture, educates the child and keeps their minds open to the possibility of other people living wonderful lives in far off places. \"Until very recently little has been known of the strange land in which the subject of this tale lives. Recent events have done much to introduce Korea and its people to the world at large. For this reason the story of Yung Pak's youthful days may be the more interesting to his Western cousins. These are stirring times in Korea, and it may safely be prophesied that the little Koreans of the present day will occupy a larger place in the world's history than have their fathers and grandfathers. Their bright eyes are now turned toward the light, and, under the uplifting influences of education and civilization, the old superstitions and antique customs are bound to give way. ...This little volume gives just a glimpse into the mode of life, the habits and customs, the traditions and superstitions, of the Koreans. If it awakens an interest in the minds of its young readers, and inspires them with a desire for further knowledge of their cousins in this far Eastern land, its purpose will be well served.\"\n(Summary by Phil Chenevert; quote from the Preface) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/ourlittlekoreanc12048gut","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7834","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/our_little_korean_cousin_1308_librivox\/our_little_korean_cousin_1308_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/our-little-korean-cousin-by-henry-lee-mitchell-pike\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:37:45","totaltimesecs":5865,"authors":[{"id":"9821","first_name":"Henry Lee Mitchell","last_name":"Pike","dob":"1865","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/our_little_korean_cousin_1308_librivox","sections":[{"id":"283300","section_number":"0","title":"PREFACE","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_00_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"118","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_00_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7850","display_name":"Jill Engle"}]},{"id":"283301","section_number":"1","title":"SOME QUEER THINGS","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_01_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"490","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_01_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283302","section_number":"2","title":"YUNG PAK'S HOME","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_02_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"568","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_02_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283303","section_number":"3","title":"A GLIMPSE OF THE KING","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_03_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"504","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_03_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283304","section_number":"4","title":"YUNG PAK AT SCHOOL","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_04_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"435","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_04_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283305","section_number":"5","title":"A LESSON IN HISTORY","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_05_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"643","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_05_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283306","section_number":"6","title":"THE MONK'S STORY","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_06_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"897","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_06_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283307","section_number":"7","title":"A JOURNEY","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_07_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1412","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_07_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283308","section_number":"8","title":"THE MONASTERY AT CHANG-AN-SA","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_08_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"462","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_08_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]},{"id":"283309","section_number":"9","title":"A FULL-FLEDGED TOP-KNOT","listen_url":"http:\/\/upload.librivox.org\/share\/uploads\/phi\/ourlittlekoreancousin_09_pike.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"336","file_name":"ourlittlekoreancousin_09_pike_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8425","display_name":"Larry Wilson"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
