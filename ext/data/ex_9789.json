{"books":{"15":{"id":"9789","title":"War Letters From A Young Queenslander","description":"Letters from a Brisbane doctor posted to the Western Front from 1914 to December 1915. He tells anecdotes of World War I from the perspective of someone who was there, including stories of \"de-lousing\" an entire regiment, examination of shrapnel injuries and other stories (will add more later.) I'm hoping to get this done before ANZAC Day, which is April 25, so a quick DPL would be appreciated!","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/LettersFromAYoungQueenslander ","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9789","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11321","first_name":"Robert Marshall","last_name":"Allen","dob":"1886","dod":"1946"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"336789","section_number":"1","title":"Aldershot","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_01_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336790","section_number":"2","title":"Boulogne","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_02_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336791","section_number":"3","title":"The R.A.M.C at Work","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_03_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336964","section_number":"4","title":"Connaught Rangers","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_04_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336792","section_number":"5","title":"Bathing and Laundry Experiences","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_05_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336963","section_number":"6","title":"Neuve Chapelle","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_06_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336794","section_number":"7","title":"With The Highlanders","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_07_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336967","section_number":"8","title":"Gas: Bane and Antidote","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_08_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336965","section_number":"9","title":"Some Lively Incidents","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/annise\/warletters_09_allan_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"337072","section_number":"10","title":"Gallipoli and Australian reflections","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336966","section_number":"11","title":"What the Indians Did","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336793","section_number":"12","title":"An Anniversary Review","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336795","section_number":"13","title":"Battle Scenes - all along the line","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336968","section_number":"14","title":"Aerial Warfare","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336969","section_number":"15","title":"Indian Types","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"336970","section_number":"16","title":"The King's Message","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"6","name":"Culture & Heritage"},{"id":"18","name":"Historical Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
