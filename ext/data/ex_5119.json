This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for January 16, 2011.<br><br>She published her first important story in the Atlantic Monthly at age 19, and her reputation grew throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Her literary importance arises from her careful, if subdued, vignettes of country life that reflect a contemporary interest in local color rather than plot. Jewett possessed a keen descriptive gift that William Dean Howells called \"an uncommon feeling for talk \u2014 I hear your people.\" (summary by Wikipedia)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/jewett01.html#musicians","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5119","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/two_musicians_1101_librivox\/two_musicians_1101_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/two-musicians-by-sarah-orne-jewett\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:32:16","totaltimesecs":1936,"authors":[{"id":"1685","first_name":"Sarah Orne","last_name":"Jewett","dob":"1849","dod":"1909"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/two_musicians_1101_librivox","sections":[{"id":"56094","section_number":"1","title":"Two Musicians - Read by ALG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"102","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4744","display_name":"Amy Gramour"}]},{"id":"56095","section_number":"2","title":"Two Musicians - Read by CC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"101","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4586","display_name":"Chris Caron"}]},{"id":"56096","section_number":"3","title":"Two Musicians - Read by CS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"111","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"92","display_name":"Cori Samuel"}]},{"id":"56097","section_number":"4","title":"Two Musicians - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"107","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"56098","section_number":"5","title":"Two Musicians - Read by DRB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"114","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"56099","section_number":"6","title":"Two Musicians - Read by EEP","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"133","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2825","display_name":"Ernst Pattynama"}]},{"id":"56100","section_number":"7","title":"Two Musicians - Read by GHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"110","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"56101","section_number":"8","title":"Two Musicians - Read by JB","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"120","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"77","display_name":"JemmaBlythe"}]},{"id":"56102","section_number":"9","title":"Two Musicians - Read by JC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"89","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5937","display_name":"Joshua Commander"}]},{"id":"56103","section_number":"10","title":"Two Musicians - Read by JCM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"115","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3470","display_name":"Jason Mills"}]},{"id":"56104","section_number":"11","title":"Two Musicians - Read by JM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"136","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4697","display_name":"Jannie Meisberger"}]},{"id":"56105","section_number":"12","title":"Two Musicians - Read by LAH","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"117","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"56106","section_number":"13","title":"Two Musicians - Read by LLW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"123","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"56107","section_number":"14","title":"Two Musicians - Read by MDK","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"122","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5991","display_name":"Marc Kockinos"}]},{"id":"56108","section_number":"15","title":"Two Musicians - Read by TG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"107","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3157","display_name":"TriciaG"}]},{"id":"56109","section_number":"16","title":"Two Musicians - Read by TK","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"126","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4610","display_name":"Tasleem Khan"}]},{"id":"56110","section_number":"17","title":"Two Musicians - Read by WT","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"103","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5694","display_name":"Winston Tharp"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"95","name":"Music"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"}],"translators":[]}}}
