{"books":{"46":{"id":"10546","title":"Twinkle and Chubbins; Their Astonishing Adventures in Nature-Fairyland","description":"Twinkle is a little girl who often finds herself caught up in fantastic adventures. Whether it be being put on trial by angry woodchucks, raising a hateful baby crow, visiting a town full of talking prairie dogs, finding magical turtles, meeting strange creatures, or stumbling upon a country of sugar people, she never knows what she'll encounter next!  First published as a series of six short chapter books in 1905 under the pen name Laura Bancroft, Frank L. Baum's The Twinkle Tales were collected into one collection titled Twinkle and Chubbins; Their Astonishing Adventures in Nature-Fairyland in 1911. The title which is a misnomer, since Chubbins (Twinkle's friend) appears in only two stories and few are set in \"Nature-Fairyland.\" Policeman Bluejay, the sequel to these stories, was published in 1907. - Summary by Mary Kay and Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/28552","language":"English","copyright_year":"1911","num_sections":"47","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10546","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Twinkle_Tales","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"406","first_name":"L.
