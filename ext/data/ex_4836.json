{"books":{"9":{"id":"4836","title":"Romance of a Christmas Card","description":"The story of the mission of two Christmas cards written by a minister\u2019s wife. These cards find their way to two straying sheep from the village fold, who hear through the message in the words, and the little scenes on the cards, the compelling voice of home. There was inspiration and good cheer in the cards, and from them came, in one case reformation, in the other romance.
