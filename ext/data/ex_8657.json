{"books":[{"id":"8657","title":"Blottentots and How to Make Them","description":"<br \/>This is very short, but it is a book with lots of pictures, and it will be even better if you can look at the pictures in the book at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/44898\">http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/44898<\/a> while you listen to the verses.<br \/><br \/>\n\nThere are many short verses: the first verses tell you how to make a blottentot with a blot of ink on a piece of paper. You then fold the paper and press it gently to spread out the ink into peculiar shapes. The rest of the verses describe the funny creatures which you can make.  I'm sure it could also be done with different colours using thin paint instead of ink, and it looks a lot of fun!<br \/><br \/>\n\nThe author John Prosper Carmel is believed to be a pseudonym of Raymond Carter, who was the calligrapher, but of whom also nothing is known.
