{"books":{"52":{"id":"565","title":"Barchester Towers","description":"<p>This is the second in Trollope\u2019s \u2018Barsetshire\u2019 series of novels. The later novels in the series move away from Barchester itself but 'Barchester Towers' is very much a sequel to the first book \u2018The Warden\u2019, which is also available from Librivox.<br><br>The old bishop dies, the archdeacon, Dr. Grantly fails to succeed him and a new bishop, Dr. Proudie is appointed. Dr. Grantly gains a worthy foe, not the new bishop but his wife, Mrs. Proudie, strict sabatarian and power behind the Episcopal throne together with the bishop\u2019s chaplain, Mr. Slope.<br><br>John Bold is also dead and Eleanor, now a wealthy young widow sets clerical hearts fluttering. The new bishop must deal with the wardenship of Hiram\u2019s Hospital. Will it go to Mr. Harding? All is to play for. Then the old Dean dies and the stakes are raised.
