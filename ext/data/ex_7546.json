{"books":{"29":{"id":"7546","title":"Joshua","description":"Hosea is a commander in Pharaoh's army... and a Hebrew.  As he returns home from war, he finds that there has been a great pestilence in Egypt and his people are being blamed for it.  Hosea receives a message from his father to follow his people to Succoth, but he is hesitant to give up his position in the army.  Someone else also sends a message, containing a new name for him from God.  There is much intrigue in this retelling of the Exodus, both among the Hebrews and in the court of Pharaoh.
