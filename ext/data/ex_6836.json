{"books":{"39":{"id":"6836","title":"Good Morning, Boys and Girls!","description":"Forty simple, delightful sermons for children.  The stories cover a full school year, all Sundays and a few holydays in between. Under such engaging chapter titles, as Chasing Rainbows, Caterpillars, The Best Christmas Gift, and Breakfast of Champions, the book entertains while it instructs. Here Heaven takes on a new closeness as \u201cGod\u2019s Home\u201d; the Bible is a collection of \u201cLetters from God\u201d; while the devil is called \u201ca Real Bogeyman.\u201d Such important subjects as beauty of soul, gratitude, Sunday Mass, the foolishness of sin, the Rosary, and temptation are dealt with in a refreshing manner guaranteed to capture the interest of every child.
