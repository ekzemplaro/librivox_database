{"books":{"11":{"id":"900","title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (version 3)","description":"\"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do ...\" .. and from that moment onward we drift with Alice into another world. When she sees a White Rabbit as it runs through the tall grass (looking worriedly at the watch it takes from its waist-coat pocket), she runs after it and drops into a strange dream. The world is full of chatty animals, from a rather stand-offish hookah-smoking caterpillar to the friendly Cheshire Cat which only sometimes goes to the bother of having a body. And everyone seems to be ordering her about ... or telling her to recite poetry! ... and all those verses that she once knew so well seem strangely distorted.<br \/><br \/>In this book and in \"Through the Looking Glass\", Lewis Carroll affectionately brought together many of the wonderful stories he told to Alice and her sisters on long summer boating trips.
