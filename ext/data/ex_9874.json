{"books":{"50":{"id":"9874","title":"Oldtown Folks","description":"Over a century ago, rural New England communities along the river in Natick, Dover, Wellesley, and Sherborn became famous as \u201cOldtown\u201d in the national bestseller Oldtown Folks by Harriet Beecher Stowe.   This was Stowe's seventh novel, following the great success of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".  Based partially on her husband Calvin Stowe's childhood memories and the residents in his village of Natick, Massachusetts. The novel depicts life at the end of the 18th century, and is one of the earliest examples of local colour writing in New England.
