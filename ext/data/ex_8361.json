{"books":{"12":{"id":"8361","title":"Lucinda","description":"Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel was born in 1772 at Hannover, Holy Roman Empire, to Johann Adolf Schlegel and Johanna Christiane Erdmuthe H\u00fcbsch. He attended Jena University and made friends with many of the writers known by his brother August Wilhelm Schlegel. His first book was <i>About the Diotima<\/i>, written in 1795, and four years later he wrote <i>Lucinda<\/i>. The translator, Calvin Thomas, called Lucinda a \"naughty book\", but that was in 1914. I have no idea where it stands now in the world of literature. It was made up of many disconnected parts. - Summary by Craig Campbell<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/12060","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8361","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/lucinda_1312_librivox\/lucinda_1312_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/lucinda-by-friedrich-von-schlegel\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:30:44","totaltimesecs":9044,"authors":[{"id":"1144","first_name":"Friedrich von","last_name":"Schlegel","dob":"1772","dod":"1829"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lucinda_1312_librivox","sections":[{"id":"298036","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction to Lucinda, by Calvin Thomas","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_00_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"596","file_name":"lucinda_00_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298025","section_number":"1","title":"Prologue\/Confessions of an Awkward Man (Julius to Lucinda)","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_01_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"662","file_name":"lucinda_01_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298026","section_number":"2","title":"Dithyrambic Fantasy on the Loveliest of Situations","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_02_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"740","file_name":"lucinda_02_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298027","section_number":"3","title":"Sketch of Little Wilhelmina","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_03_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"426","file_name":"lucinda_03_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298028","section_number":"4","title":"An Idyl of Idleness","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_04_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"899","file_name":"lucinda_04_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298029","section_number":"5","title":"Constancy and Play","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_05_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1525","file_name":"lucinda_05_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298030","section_number":"6","title":"Metamorphoses","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_06_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"354","file_name":"lucinda_06_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298031","section_number":"7","title":"Two Letters: One","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_07_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1191","file_name":"lucinda_07_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298032","section_number":"8","title":"Two Letters: Two","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_08_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"697","file_name":"lucinda_08_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298033","section_number":"9","title":"A Reflection","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_09_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"572","file_name":"lucinda_09_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298034","section_number":"10","title":"Julius To Antonio","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_10_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"625","file_name":"lucinda_10_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"301428","section_number":"11","title":"Longing and Peace","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_11_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"374","file_name":"lucinda_11_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]},{"id":"298035","section_number":"12","title":"Dallyings Of The Fantasy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/lucinda_12_schlegel_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"383","file_name":"lucinda_12_schlegel_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3374","display_name":"Craig Campbell"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"6","name":"Culture & Heritage"},{"id":"9","name":"Erotica"},{"id":"27","name":"Romance"}],"translators":[{"id":"10211","first_name":"Paul Bernard","last_name":"Thomas","dob":"","dod":""}]}}}
