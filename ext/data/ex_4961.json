{"books":{"16":{"id":"4961","title":"Killgloom Park","description":"<p>Join Angelo Daily and his chums during a fun filled summer at Killgloom Park, a Coney Island, New York amusement park in the 1930's. A runaway tiger! Tracking down a wanted thief! Climbing down a ferris wheel in the middle of the night! These are just a few of the exciting things that happen during this adventurous summer!<br><br>\n\nThe author grew up in the world of amusement parks, providing first hand material for two of his boys books \u2013 \u201cOn the Sands of Coney\u201d and its sequel, this title - \u201cKillgloom Park\u201d. (\u201cOn the Sands of Coney\u201d is still under copyright, and cannot be recorded, but it is not necessary to be familiar with it to enjoy this book!) The author was a Catholic Jesuit Priest, and in 1926 he was appointed a Scout Chaplain for the Greater New York City Scout Camps. He spent many years involved with the Boy Scouts, and wrote a long list of stories and books, mainly fiction, for and about scouts.
