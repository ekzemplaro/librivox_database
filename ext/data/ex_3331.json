{"books":{"20":{"id":"3331","title":"Aunt Jane's Hero","description":"<P>Aunt Jane is a good and loving woman, important to everyone except herself, always willing to give good advice. Her \"hero\", Horace, is far different: in the beginning of the story, he is a good but a little unthoughtful youth. But at the end, his unthoughtfulness is replaced by his love to god.
