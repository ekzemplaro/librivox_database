{"books":{"8":{"id":"5917","title":"Clouds Cover the Campus","description":"On an American college campus, in the early years of World War II, a professor from Germany is murdered and the plans for a new bomb sight he had invented are missing.  Who murdered the professor and stole the plans? And are the accidents happening with alarming frequency to young student aviators from the campus really accidents -- or is some unknown conspiracy afoot?<br><br>This mystery novel was written by Daniel A Lord, S.J., a priest and popular American Catholic writer. The subjects of the works in his bibliography range from religion, humor, plays, songs, mysteries and even politics. His most influential work was possibly in drafting the 1930 Production Code for motion pictures.
