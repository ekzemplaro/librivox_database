{"books":{"19":{"id":"204","title":"Personal Anthology of Shakespeare","description":"<p>This personal anthology is my choice of speeches from Shakespeare that I enjoy reading (that I would like to have had by heart years ago!) and that seem to me to illustrate his unsurpassed use of language. He was a man who seemed to know everything about human nature and as Orson Welles said \u2018he speaks to everyone and we all claim him\u2019. I know that it has been said that \u2018it is impossible to be a great Shakespearian actor without an idiosyncratic and extraordinary voice\u2019 and this may be so, but that does not preclude ordinary mortals from reading, hearing and enjoying Shakespeare.
