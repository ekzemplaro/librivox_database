{"books":{"10":{"id":"10201","title":"Dutch Courage and Other Stories","description":"Jack London was quoted as saying, \"I've never written a line that I'd be ashamed for my young daughters to read, and I never shall write such a line!\" After his death in 1916, his wife Charmian assembled a collection of stories, most of which he had written for young readers, but at least one of which was for more mature readers, \"Whose Business is to Live.\" Like most of London's work, his short stories could be read by young readers and then again when they were older with mature minds. These stories draw from London's own extensive experience in the world and demonstrate the dictum that \"good writing is good writing\" no matter for whom it was written.  - Summary by Don W.
