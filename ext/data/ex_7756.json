{"books":{"31":{"id":"7756","title":"Waiting on God","description":"Andrew Murray wrote in the introduction to this daily devotional book of one month\u2019s readings, of the need that many Christians feel of being helped to a deeper and clearer insight into all that Christ could be to them. In this volume he shows both the need and the benefit of waiting upon God, and of giving God time and place to show us what He can do and what He will do. The author encourages us to enlarge our hearts and not limit God; to understand that God can do new things, unheard of things, and hidden things. \u201cWhen Thou camest down, Thou didst terrible things we looked not for; the mountains flowed down at Thy presence.\u201d (Summary by Christopher Smith) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/waitingongoddail00murr","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"32","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7756","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/waitingongod_cs_librivox\/waitingongod_cs_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/waiting-on-god-by-andrew-murray\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:13:04","totaltimesecs":11584,"authors":[{"id":"2839","first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Murray","dob":"1828","dod":"1917"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/waitingongod_cs_librivox","sections":[{"id":"118991","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
