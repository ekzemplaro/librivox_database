Railing against Industrialization\u2019s dehumanization, he preached a return to a simple life in harmony with Nature.  Towards Democracy reads like Beat poetry\u2014wild flowing word associations, moments of insight so clear they hurt, interspersed with pure rant!   Included is an essay Carpenter wrote in 1894 explaining his intent and feelings in writing Towards Democracy.  - Summary by Sue Anderson<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/democracytowards00carpuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1883","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8286","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/towards_democracy_sa_librivox\/towards_democracy_sa_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edward_Carpenter","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/towards-democracy-by-edward-carpenter\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:55:06","totaltimesecs":14106,"authors":[{"id":"8424","first_name":"Edward","last_name":"Carpenter","dob":"1844","dod":"1929"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/towards_democracy_sa_librivox","sections":[{"id":"296293","section_number":"0","title":"Preface: A Note on Towards Democracy","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/towardsdemocracy_00_carpenter_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1310","file_name":"towardsdemocracy_00_carpenter_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"3003","display_name":"Sue Anderson"}]},{"id":"296294","section_number":"1","title":"I -
