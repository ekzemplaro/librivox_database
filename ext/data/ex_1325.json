{"books":{"5":{"id":"1325","title":"Tales of Chekhov Vol. 01","description":"This is the first of thirteen volumes of Anton Chekhov's short stories, translated by Constance Garnett.<br \/><br \/>Anton Chekhov was a Russian doctor who turned to fiction as a hobby, and quickly blossomed into one of the masters of the short story genre.  Though he is arguably best known for his dramatic works, such as <i>The Cherry Orchard<\/i>, his stories are widely considered to be some of the most perfect examples of short fiction ever written.<br \/><br \/>Constance Black Garnett was an English housewife who taught herself Russian as a hobby, and subsequently introduced the English-speaking world to some of the greatest Russian authors, including Chekhov and Dostoevsky.  Though she was almost entirely self-taught in her knowledge of Russian, she was a prolific translator, and her works are still lauded today for their readability and accuracy.
