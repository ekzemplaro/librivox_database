{"books":{"25":{"id":"1948","title":"Blackfeet Indian Stories","description":"The Blackfeet were hunters, travelling from place to place on foot. They used implements of stone, wood, or bone, wore clothing made of skins, and lived in tents covered by hides. Dogs, their only tame animals, were used as beasts of burden to carry small packs and drag light loads. \n\nThe stories here told come down to us from very ancient times. Grandfathers have told them to their grandchildren, and these again to their grandchildren, and so from mouth to mouth, through many generations, they have reached our time.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/13833","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1948","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/blackfeet_indian_stories_0805_librivox\/blackfeet_indian_stories_0805_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/blackfeet-indian-stories-by-george-b-grinnell\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:20:09","totaltimesecs":15609,"authors":[{"id":"4717","first_name":" George Bird","last_name":"Grinnell","dob":"1849","dod":"1938"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/blackfeet_indian_stories_0805_librivox","sections":[{"id":"155641","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
