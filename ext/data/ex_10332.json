{"books":{"21":{"id":"10332","title":"American Big-Game Hunting","description":"The first book published by the Boone and Crockett Club, founded by Theodore Roosevelt and George Grinnell, who declared in their Editors note: Hunting big game in the wilderness is, above all things, a sport for a vigorous and masterful people. The rifle-bearing hunter, whether he goes on foot or on horseback, whether he voyages in a canoe or travels with a dog-sled, must be sound of body and firm of mind, and must possess energy, resolution, manliness, self-reliance, and capacity for hardy self-help. In short, the big-game hunter must possess qualities without which no race can do its life-work well; and these are the very qualities which it is the purpose of this Club, so far as may be, to develop and foster.  A bit outdated as to modern equipment and technique, this book is nevertheless a great look at the west in earlier days.  Each chapter focuses on a different animal, from buffalo, mountain goat, elk, pronghorn sheep, grizzlies, etc., and gives insight into the times and views of the first hunters and conservationists in America, and even today, captures the spirit of the hunt. -
