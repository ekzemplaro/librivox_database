{"books":{"21":{"id":"9996","title":"Exiles","description":"The basic premise of Exiles involves a love triangle between Richard Rowan (a Dublin writer recently returned from exile in Rome), Bertha (his common law wife) and his old friend Robert Hand (a journalist). (There are obvious parallels to be drawn with Joyce's own life \u2013 Joyce and Nora Barnacle lived, unmarried, in Trieste, during the years the fictional Rowans were living in Rome, while Robert Hand is roughly the same age of Joyce's friends Oliver St. John Gogarty and Vincent Cosgrave, and shares some characteristics with them both.) This arrangement is slightly complicated by a second love triangle, involving Rowan, Hand, and Hand's cousin Beatrice Justice. (The fictional Beatrice, who in the play has recovered from a life-threatening illness, is just two years younger than Joyce's cousin Elizabeth Justice, who died in 1912.) Bertha is jealous of Rowan's relationship with Beatrice, and Hand is jealous of Rowan's relationship with Bertha. Joyce himself described the structure of the play as \"three cat and mouse acts\", and the action mostly involves Robert Hand's attempts to pounce on Bertha. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/exilesaplayinth00joycgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1918","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9996","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exiles_(play)","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"495","first_name":"James","last_name":"Joyce","dob":"1882","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"343531","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343532","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343533","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343534","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343535","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343536","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343537","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343538","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343539","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343540","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343541","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343542","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343543","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343544","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343545","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343546","section_number":"16","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343547","section_number":"17","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343548","section_number":"18","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343549","section_number":"19","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343550","section_number":"20","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343551","section_number":"21","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"343552","section_number":"22","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"58","name":"Drama"}],"translators":[]}}}
