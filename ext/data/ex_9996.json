{"books":{"65":{"id":"9996","title":"Don Juan","description":"Don Juan (Spanish), Don Giovanni (Italian) is a legendary, fictional libertine.  Although the various iterations of the Don Juan myth show some variation, the basic story remains the same. Don Juan is portrayed as a wealthy, seductive libertine who devotes his life to seducing women, taking great pride in his ability to seduce women of all ages and stations in life. Don Giovanni, an opera composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, is arguably the best-known version. First performed in Prague in 1787, it inspired works by E. T. A. Hoffmann, Alexander Pushkin, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, George Bernard Shaw, and Albert Camus.<br><br>Here, Librivox volunteers read an English translation of da Ponte's libretto.","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/dongiovannidonj00dentgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1850","num_sections":"66","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9996","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11471","first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"Da Ponte","dob":"1749","dod":"1838"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"343531","section_number":"1","title":"Don Juan (aka D.J.)
