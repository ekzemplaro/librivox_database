Bailey's writing has been described thusly by the Newark Evening News: \"Mr. Bailey centered all his plots in the animal, bird and insect worlds, weaving natural history into the stories in a way that won educator's approval without arousing the suspicions of his young readers. He made it a habit to never 'write down' to children and frequently used words beyond the average juvenile vocabulary, believing that youngsters respond to the stimulus of the unfamiliar.\"\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arthur_Scott_Bailey<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/21845","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1269","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/peter_mink_lb_librivox\/peter_mink_lb_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-tale-of-peter-mink-by-arthur-scott-bailey\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:53:22","totaltimesecs":6802,"authors":[{"id":"464","first_name":"Arthur Scott","last_name":"Bailey","dob":"1877","dod":"1949"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/peter_mink_lb_librivox","sections":[{"id":"142106","section_number":"1","title":"01 \u2013 How Peter Was Different","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"289","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142107","section_number":"2","title":" 02 \u2013 Sawing Wood ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"414","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142108","section_number":"3","title":" 03 \u2013 Making Peter Work","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"393","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142109","section_number":"4","title":"04 \u2013 The Lecture","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"401","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142110","section_number":"5","title":"05 \u2013 Passing The Hat","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"445","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142111","section_number":"6","title":"06 \u2013 Peter\u2019s Bad Temper","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"337","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142112","section_number":"7","title":"07 \u2013 Peter\u2019s Bad Temper","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"337","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142113","section_number":"8","title":"08 \u2013 At The Garden Party","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"341","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142114","section_number":"9","title":" 09 \u2013 Helping Jimmy Rabbit","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"377","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142115","section_number":"10","title":"10 \u2013 What Could Peter Do?","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"352","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142116","section_number":"11","title":"11 \u2013 The Circus Parade","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"334","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142117","section_number":"12","title":"12 \u2013 Peter Learns A New Word","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"392","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142118","section_number":"13","title":"13 \u2013 Good News About Peter ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"337","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142119","section_number":"14","title":"14 \u2013 Uncle Jerry Helps","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"322","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142120","section_number":"15","title":"15 \u2013 Peter\u2019s New Coat","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"327","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142121","section_number":"16","title":"16 \u2013 The Duck Pond","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"390","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142122","section_number":"17","title":"17 \u2013 How To Be Lucky ","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"293","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142123","section_number":"18","title":"18 \u2013 A Bargain","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"383","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]},{"id":"142124","section_number":"19","title":" 19 \u2013 Settling A Dispute","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"338","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"38","name":"Animals & Nature"}],"translators":[]}}}
