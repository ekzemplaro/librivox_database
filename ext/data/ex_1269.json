{"books":{"18":{"id":"1269","title":"Tale of Peter Mink","description":"Arthur Scott Bailey (1877 \u2013 1949) was author of more than forty children's books. Bailey's writing has been described thusly by the Newark Evening News: \"Mr. Bailey centered all his plots in the animal, bird and insect worlds, weaving natural history into the stories in a way that won educator's approval without arousing the suspicions of his young readers. He made it a habit to never 'write down' to children and frequently used words beyond the average juvenile vocabulary, believing that youngsters respond to the stimulus of the unfamiliar.\"\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arthur_Scott_Bailey<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/21845","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1269","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/peter_mink_lb_librivox\/peter_mink_lb_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-tale-of-peter-mink-by-arthur-scott-bailey\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:53:22","totaltimesecs":6802,"authors":[{"id":"464","first_name":"Arthur Scott","last_name":"Bailey","dob":"1877","dod":"1949"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/peter_mink_lb_librivox","sections":[{"id":"142106","section_number":"1","title":"01 \u2013 How Peter Was Different","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"289","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"681","display_name":"Lucy Burgoyne (1950 -
