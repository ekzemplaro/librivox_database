{"books":{"13":{"id":"7820","title":"Redburn: His First Voyage","description":"Melville wrote of some of his earliest experiences at sea in the story of Wellingborough Redburn, a wet-behind-the-ears youngster whose head was filled with dreams of foreign travel and adventure. In Redburn, the protagonist enlists for a stint as a seaman aboard Highlander, a merchant ship running between New York and London. As with many of Melville's works, this one is as much about class and race as it is about the sea. (Summary by James K. White)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8118","language":"English","copyright_year":"1849","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7820","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/redburn_1306_librivox\/redburn_1306_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Redburn","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/redburn-his-first-voyage-by-herman-melville\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"12:36:48","totaltimesecs":45408,"authors":[{"id":"329","first_name":"Herman","last_name":"Melville","dob":"1819","dod":"1891"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/redburn_1306_librivox","sections":[{"id":"119937","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapters I - V","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3573","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5985","display_name":"James K.
