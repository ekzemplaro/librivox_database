This was the Weekly Poetry project for March 4, 2012.<br><br>Allan Cunningham was a Scottish poet and author. Cunningham was apprenticed to a stonemason, but gave his leisure to reading and writing imitations of old Scottish ballads. His prose is often spoiled by its misplaced and too ambitious rhetoric; his verse also is ornate, and both are full of mannerisms. Some of his songs, however, hold a high place among British lyrics. \"A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea\" is one of the best British sea-songs, although written by a landsman.(Summary by Wikipedia)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/106\/205.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6454","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/wetsheet_flowingsea_1203_librivox\/wetsheet_flowingsea_1203_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-wet-sheet-and-a-flowing-sea-by-allan-cunningham\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:34:13","totaltimesecs":2053,"authors":[{"id":"2829","first_name":"Allan","last_name":"Cunningham","dob":"1784","dod":"1842"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/wetsheet_flowingsea_1203_librivox","sections":[{"id":"91294","section_number":"1","title":"A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea -
