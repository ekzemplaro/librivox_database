{"books":{"9":{"id":"10705","title":"Sleeper","description":"Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. Widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/10031","language":"English","copyright_year":"1845","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10705","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/the_sleeper_1603.poem_librivox\/the_sleeper_1603.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:37:53","totaltimesecs":2273,"authors":[{"id":"21","first_name":"Edgar Allan","last_name":"Poe","dob":"1809","dod":"1849"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/the_sleeper_1603.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"364459","section_number":"1","title":"The Sleeper - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"210","file_name":"sleeper_poe_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"364455","section_number":"2","title":"The Sleeper - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"245","file_name":"sleeper_poe_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"364451","section_number":"3","title":"The Sleeper - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"219","file_name":"sleeper_poe_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"364458","section_number":"4","title":"The Sleeper - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"213","file_name":"sleeper_poe_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"364457","section_number":"5","title":"The Sleeper - Read by JDL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_jdl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"197","file_name":"sleeper_poe_jdl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10730","display_name":"James Lapine"}]},{"id":"364452","section_number":"6","title":"The Sleeper - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"252","file_name":"sleeper_poe_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"364454","section_number":"7","title":"The Sleeper - Read by PJC","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_pjc_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"251","file_name":"sleeper_poe_pjc_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10734","display_name":"smiley1"}]},{"id":"364450","section_number":"8","title":"The Sleeper - Read by PS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_ps_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"230","file_name":"sleeper_poe_ps_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8576","display_name":"Phil Schempf"}]},{"id":"364453","section_number":"9","title":"The Sleeper - Read by PY","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_py_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"233","file_name":"sleeper_poe_py_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"167","display_name":"Peter Yearsley"}]},{"id":"364456","section_number":"10","title":"The Sleeper - Read by RF","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/sleeper_poe_rf_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"223","file_name":"sleeper_poe_rf_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10645","display_name":"Ryan Finch"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
