{"books":{"29":{"id":"4482","title":"Elements of Geology","description":"<p>Geology is a science of such rapid growth that no apology is expected when from time to time a new text-book is added to those already in the field. The present work, however, is the outcome of the need of a text-book of very simple outline, in which causes and their consequences should be knit together as closely as possible,\u2014a need long felt by the author in his teaching, and perhaps by other teachers also. The author has ventured, therefore, to depart from the common usage which subdivides geology into a number of departments,\u2014dynamical, structural, physiographic, and historical,\u2014and to treat in immediate connection with each geological process the land forms and the rock structures which it has produced.
