As he states in the editorial of the April 1906 issue (Vol 1, Iss 2) this was a sort of supplement to the editor's popular monthly, Munsey's Magazine http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Munsey's_Magazine. The Scrap Book is very like an American version of Punch with many short, often humorous articles interspersed with at least one short story, some poetry, and several longer non-fic pieces. The Scrap Book ran up to 1912.(Summary by BellonaTimes)","url_text_source":"","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4270","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/scrap_book_v1_sampler_1006_librivox\/scrap_book_v1_sampler_1006_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-scrap-book-volume-1-sampler-by-various\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:23:27","totaltimesecs":19407,"authors":[{"id":"18","first_name":"","last_name":"Various","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/scrap_book_v1_sampler_1006_librivox","sections":[{"id":"33580","section_number":"1","title":"Coming Test of American Resources, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"460","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33581","section_number":"2","title":"Progress of Women, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1437","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33582","section_number":"3","title":"Descent Into The Maelstrom","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2587","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33583","section_number":"4","title":"Great Southwest, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"784","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33584","section_number":"5","title":"Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, An","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1644","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33585","section_number":"6","title":"World's Fastest Trains The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"690","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33586","section_number":"7","title":"Creating Wealth From Waste","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1125","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33587","section_number":"8","title":"Tapestried Chamber, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2358","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33588","section_number":"9","title":"Story of the Snow Elinora, The","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"920","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33589","section_number":"10","title":"Feminine Rule May Doom Our Country","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"447","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33590","section_number":"11","title":"When Vesuvius Destroyed Pompeii","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1233","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33591","section_number":"12","title":"Niagara, the June Bride's Paradise","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1563","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33592","section_number":"13","title":"Patrick Henry's Call to Arms","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"574","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33593","section_number":"14","title":"Our National Anthem","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"445","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33594","section_number":"15","title":"From The Country Press","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"648","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33595","section_number":"16","title":"Liquor Dealers Come Out For Temperance","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"395","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33596","section_number":"17","title":"Good Manners Fifty Years Ago","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"980","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]},{"id":"33597","section_number":"18","title":"Course From Trimalchio's Dinner, A","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1117","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3657","display_name":"Bellona Times"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
