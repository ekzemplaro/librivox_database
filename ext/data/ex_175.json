{"books":{"18":{"id":"175","title":"Little Princess","description":"<p>The novel tells of the troubles of a wealthy young girl, Sara Crewe, who is sent to an oppressive London boarding school during her father\u2019s campaign in India. Thanks to Capt. Crewe\u2019s money, Sara is treated as a little princess until, one day, word comes of her father\u2019s tragic death. Miss Minchin, the school\u2019s greedy headmistress, wastes no time in putting the now-penniless Sara to work for her room and board. It is only through the friendship of two other girls, her own resolute nature, and some astonishing luck that Sara eventually finds her way back to happiness.
