{"books":{"51":{"id":"9509","title":"Sacred Meditations","description":"Meditationes Sacrae, was first published in Latin in 1606 when Gerhard was only twenty-two years old. It consists of 51 brief meditations on various aspects of the Christian life. Nearly four hundred years after its first appearance, it remains the only work published by such a young author that has stood the test of time. Frequently reprinted in Latin, it has also been translated into most European languages as well as Greek and Arabic. While not a large book, it is impactive beyond its size.  - Jonathan
