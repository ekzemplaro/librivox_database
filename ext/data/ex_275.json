{"books":[{"id":"275","title":"Euthyphro","description":"Awaiting his trial on charges of impiety and heresy, Socrates encounters Euthyphro, a self-proclaimed authority on matters of piety and the will of the gods. Socrates, desiring instruction in these matters, converses with Euthyphro, but as usual, the man who professes to know nothing fares better than the man who claims to be an expert. One of Plato\u2019s well-known Socratic Dialogues, Euthyphro probes the nature of piety, and notably poses the so-called Euthyphro Dilemma: Do the gods love a thing because it is holy, or is a thing holy because it is loved by the gods? <p>(Summary by LauraFox)\n<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1642","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"1","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/275","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/euthyphro_librivox\/euthyphro_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Euthyphro","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/euthyphro-by-plato\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"40.19","totaltimesecs":40.19,"authors":[{"id":"599","first_name":"","last_name":"Plato (\u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd)","dob":"c. 428 BC","dod":"c. 347 BC"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/euthyphro_librivox","sections":[{"id":"124467","section_number":"1","title":"Full Dialog","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"2419","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"163","display_name":"Andrew Miller"},{"reader_id":"873","display_name":"David Miller"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"123","name":"Ancient"}],"translators":[{"id":"6459","first_name":" Benjamin","last_name":"Jowett","dob":"1817","dod":"1893"}]}]}
