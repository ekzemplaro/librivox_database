{"books":{"10":{"id":"8645","title":"Life of Saint Monica","description":"This book is above all things the story of a mother. But it is also the story of a noble woman\u2014a woman who was truly great, for the reason that she never sought to be so. Because she understood the sphere in which a woman's work in the world must usually lie, and led her life truly along the lines that God had laid down for her; because she suffered bravely, forgot herself for others, and remained faithful to her noble ideals, she ruled as a queen amongst those with whom her life was cast. Her influence was great and far-reaching, but she herself was the last to suspect it, the last to desire it, and that was perhaps the secret of its greatness. The type is rare at the present day, but, thank God! there are Monicas still in the world. If there were more, the world would be a better place. - Summary from the book","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/35941","language":"English","copyright_year":"1928","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8645","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/lifeofsaintmonica_1403_librivox\/lifeofsaintmonica_1403_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-life-of-saint-monica-by-francis-alice-forbes\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:07:51","totaltimesecs":7671,"authors":[{"id":"3580","first_name":"Francis Alice","last_name":"Forbes","dob":"1869","dod":"1936"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lifeofsaintmonica_1403_librivox","sections":[{"id":"305208","section_number":"1","title":"How St. Monica was Brought Up by Christian Parents in the City of Tagaste","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_01_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"696","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_01_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"305209","section_number":"2","title":"How St. Monica Lived in the Pagan Household of Her Husband Patricius","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_02_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"715","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_02_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"305210","section_number":"3","title":"How St. Monica Brought Up Her Children, and How Little Augustine Fell Sick and Desired Baptism","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_03_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"670","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_03_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"305211","section_number":"4","title":"How St. Monica by Her Gentleness and Charity Won Patricius and His Mother to Christ","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_04_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"819","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_04_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"305212","section_number":"5","title":"How Augustine Went to Carthage and How Patricius Died a Christian Death","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_05_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"686","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_05_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8630","display_name":"Eduardo"}]},{"id":"305213","section_number":"6","title":"How St. Monica Lived in the Days of Her Widowhood, and How She Put All Her Trust in God","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_06_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"840","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_06_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8630","display_name":"Eduardo"}]},{"id":"305214","section_number":"7","title":"How St. Monica's Heart Was Well Nigh Broken by the News that Her Son had Adjured the Christian Faith","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_07_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"607","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_07_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"305215","section_number":"8","title":"How Augustine Planned to Go to Rome, and How He Cruelly Deceived His Mother","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_08_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"576","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_08_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"305216","section_number":"9","title":"How Augustine Came to Milan, and How His Tempest-Tossed Soul Found Light and Peace at Last","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_09_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"772","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_09_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5756","display_name":"Mich_elle"}]},{"id":"305217","section_number":"10","title":"How St. Monica Lived at Cassiacum with Augustine and His Friends, and How Augustine was Baptized by St. Ambrose","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_10_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"770","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_10_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8846","display_name":"MariaS"}]},{"id":"305218","section_number":"11","title":"How St. Monica Set Out for Africa with St. Augustine, and how She Died at Ostia on the Tiber","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/m8b1\/lifeofsaintmonica_11_forbes.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"520","file_name":"lifeofsaintmonica_11_forbes_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9001","display_name":"Mary Kay"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"},{"id":"129","name":"Christianity - Biographies"}],"translators":[]}}}
