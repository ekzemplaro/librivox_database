She was a staunch Royalist (a supporter of Charles I and his son during the English Civil Wars) and wrote poetic defenses of the monarchy. She was also part of a literary coterie, in which she and her friends had \"code names.\" Philips herself was \"Orinda,\" her husband \"Antenor,\" and her friend Anne Owen \"Lucasia.\" She is perhaps best known today for her passionate poems celebrating female friendship.
