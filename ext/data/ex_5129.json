{"books":{"1":{"id":"5129","title":"Make Mine Homogenized","description":"Widowed cattle rancher Hetty Thompson had done all right for herself since Big Jim\u2019s death. She had Barney, a loyal if dim-witted ranch hand, and Johnny her assistant manager whom she rescued from a drunken father years before. When the government carves out a huge piece of Frenchman\u2019s Flat for an atomic testing ground Hetty and her neighbors object, but the millitary fences in the range anyway. It wasn\u2019t so bad for a while. Then Hetty\u2019s chickens began laying golden eggs, and her prize Guernsey produced explosive milk. Nevada ranch folk are tough but are they ready for mutant livestock?
