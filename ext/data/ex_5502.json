This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for May 15, 2011.<br><br>Walter \"Walt\" Whitman was an American poet, essayist and journalist. A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse. His work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection Leaves of Grass, which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality.(summary by Wikipedia)<br>The first edition of Leaves of Grass was very small, collecting only twelve unnamed poems in 95 pages. Whitman continued to expand the editions until the ninth and final edition of almost 400 poems.(summary by David Lawrence)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1322","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5502","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/oldchants_1105_librivox\/oldchants_1105_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Leaves_of_Grass","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/old-chants-by-walt-whitman\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:24:42","totaltimesecs":1482,"authors":[{"id":"588","first_name":"Walt","last_name":"Whitman","dob":"1819","dod":"1892"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/oldchants_1105_librivox","sections":[{"id":"66677","section_number":"1","title":"Old Chants - Read by CC","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"116","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4586","display_name":"Chris Caron"}]},{"id":"66678","section_number":"2","title":"Old Chants - Read by CD","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"156","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2733","display_name":"CalmDragon"}]},{"id":"66679","section_number":"3","title":"Old Chants - Read by CRM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"104","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5802","display_name":"Christopher Maust"}]},{"id":"66680","section_number":"4","title":"Old Chants - Read by DL","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"134","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"66681","section_number":"5","title":"Old Chants - Read by EP","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"163","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2525","display_name":"loubet"}]},{"id":"66682","section_number":"6","title":"Old Chants - Read by GHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"132","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"66683","section_number":"7","title":"Old Chants - Read by JCM","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"125","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3470","display_name":"Jason Mills"}]},{"id":"66684","section_number":"8","title":"Old Chants - Read by LLW","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"138","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"66685","section_number":"9","title":"Old Chants - Read by RMG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"150","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6446","display_name":"Bob Gonzalez"}]},{"id":"66686","section_number":"10","title":"Old Chants - Read by RN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"147","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3465","display_name":"ravenotation"}]},{"id":"66687","section_number":"11","title":"Old Chants - Read by TG","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"117","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3157","display_name":"TriciaG"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "},{"id":"104","name":"Self-Help"}],"translators":[]}}}
