{"books":{"18":{"id":"9603","title":"In the  Line of Battle","description":"\u201cA COLLECTION OF absolutely authentic accounts by privates and non-commissioned officers.... We see a great simplicity and directness of observation and recital, so admirable that one page of such writing is worth all the folios of the war experts and correspondents, not to say romancers and publicists.\u201d The Athen\u00e6um.\n\u201cTHE HUMAN SIDE, the naked horror and simple glory of actual conflict, is what Mr. Wood\u2019s soldiers are concerned with, and the stories they tell give a clearer picture of this side of war than can be found in any other form.\u201d Pall Mall Gazette.\n\u201cA VERY REAL and deeply affecting book, and the editor has done a valuable work in collecting these poignant, odd, whimsical, terrible stories together.\u201d Westminster Gazette.\n\u201cNO MAN WHO boasts a heart, least of all any man of young limbs, will read these soldiers\u2019 simple stories without a quickening of the pulse. They are at once a great stimulus and a great memorial.\u201d Daily Telegraph.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/48107","language":"English","copyright_year":"1916","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9603","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1298","first_name":"Walter","last_name":"Wood","dob":"1866","dod":"?"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"330745","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/lineofbattle_00_wood_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8138","display_name":"Lee
