{"books":{"25":{"id":"9775","title":"Fortunate Foundlings","description":"A story of love and adventure, following the fortunes of a young man and woman each trying to make their way in the wide world. Horatio and Louisa are twins, abandoned in infancy and adopted by a wealthy bachelor.  For various reasons both leave his protection and set off independently: Plucky and determined Louisa must defend her virtue and make her way in a man\u2019s world, and her spirited brother seeks his fortune in the army. This energetic narrative gallops from city to court, from battlefield to convent, and across a number of European countries. Written in 1744 (when the novel was just emerging as a form) by actress and prolific author Eliza Haywood, this is an eighteenth century rollercoaster - action packed, passionate, melodramatic, and often unashamedly sentimental.  - Summary by Helen
