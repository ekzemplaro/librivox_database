{"books":{"19":{"id":"4787","title":"Short Science Fiction Collection 042","description":"Science Fiction is speculative literature that generally explores the consequences of ideas which are roughly consistent with nature and scientific method, but are not facts of the author\u2019s contemporary world. The stories often represent philosophical thought experiments presented in entertaining ways. Protagonists typically \u201cthink\u201d rather than \u201cshoot\u201d their way out of problems, but the definition is flexible because there are no limits on an author\u2019s imagination. The reader-selected stories presented here were written prior to 1962 and became US public domain texts when their copyrights expired.
