{"books":{"12":{"id":"8815","title":"Paradise Lost","description":"As Vergil had surpassed Homer by adapting the epic form to celebrate the origin of the author\u2019s nation, Milton developed it yet further to recount the origin of the human race itself and, in particular, the origin of and the remedy for evil; this is what he refers to as \u201cthings unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.\u201d<br \/><br \/>After a statement of its purpose, the poem plunges, like its epic predecessors, into the midst of the action, shockingly bringing to the front the traditional visit to the underworld, for Satan\u2019s malice is the mainspring of the negative action.  But at the center of the poem lies the Son of God\u2019s triumph over the angelic rebels, which counteracts Satan\u2019s evil design.  To preview this pattern, the fallen angels\u2019 council in hell is counterbalanced by a council in heaven, in which the Son offers himself as a scapegoat for mankind long before the original sin has been committed.<br \/><br \/>With this background, the narrator introduces us to Eden and our \u201cGrand Parents.\u201d  Satan is detected spying on them and is expelled from the garden, and then Adam is educated by an angel in the history of the heavenly war that has led to the present situation, the creation of the earth, and the proper nature of development, whereby all things proceed from lower to higher by refining that which nourishes them.<br \/><br \/>Satan, however, returns in the form of a snake and offers Eve an evolutionary shortcut in the form of a magical food capable of endowing her with super powers.  He claims it has conferred on him both reason and speech.  Since Eve has not received the same angelic instruction as Adam, she is beguiled.  Adam, though, knows better and yet, unable to imagine life without Eve (and failing to explore alternatives to sin), he too eats. <br \/><br \/>Satan\u2019s triumph is short-lived, for although hell and the world of mankind are now linked by a broad highway, he and his followers are humiliated in hell by being turned involuntarily into snakes every year.<br \/><br \/>Whatever their reasons, both Adam and Eve have disobeyed their Maker\u2019s sole command, and both are condemned to mortality and expulsion from the garden, but before they leave they are vouchsafed another history lesson, this time of the world to come: the progress of sin, the Savior\u2019s coming, and the growth of the church.
