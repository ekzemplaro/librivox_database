{"books":{"5":{"id":"5390","title":"Bible (KJV) NT 09-12: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians","description":"<br\/><b>Galatians<\/b> is a letter from Paul of Tarsus to a number of Early Christian communities in the Roman province of Galatia in central Anatolia. Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law within Early Christianity.<br\/><br\/>\n\nThe main theme of <b>Ephesians<\/b> is \u201cthe Church, the Body of Christ.\u201d The Church is to maintain the unity in practice which Christ has brought about positionally. Another major theme in Ephesians is the keeping of Christ's body (that is, the Church) pure and holy.<br\/><br\/>\n\n<b>Philippians<\/b> was written by the Apostle Paul circa 62 while Paul was in prison. The letter was written to the church at Philippi, one of the earliest churches to be founded in Europe. They were very attached to Paul, just as he was very fond of them. The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, their messenger, with contributions to meet the needs of Paul; and on his return Paul sent this letter with him.<br\/><br\/>\n\nWritten in the 50s while Paul was in prison, <b>Colossians<\/b> is similar to Ephesians, also written at this time. Colossians declares Christ's supremacy over the entire created universe and exhorts Christians to lead godly lives. The letter consists of two parts: first a doctrinal section, then a second regarding conduct. In both sections, false teachers who have been spreading error in the congregation are opposed.<br\/><br\/>\n\n(Modified from Wikipedia)<br\/><br\/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/7999","language":"English","copyright_year":"1611","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5390","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/bible_4epistles_kjv_1104_librivox\/bible_4epistles_kjv_1104_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/4-epistles-king-james-version\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:24:29","totaltimesecs":5069,"authors":[{"id":"950","first_name":"","last_name":"King James Version (KJV)","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/bible_4epistles_kjv_1104_librivox","sections":[{"id":"63604","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Galatians 1-3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"863","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6039","display_name":"Sundiata"}]},{"id":"63605","section_number":"2","title":"2 - Galatians 4-6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"602","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6295","display_name":"Michael Packard"}]},{"id":"63606","section_number":"3","title":"3 - Ephesians 1-3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"702","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6039","display_name":"Sundiata"}]},{"id":"63607","section_number":"4","title":"4 - Ephesians 4-6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"776","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6295","display_name":"Michael Packard"}]},{"id":"63608","section_number":"5","title":"5 - Philippians","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1100","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6039","display_name":"Sundiata"}]},{"id":"63609","section_number":"6","title":"6 - Colossians","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1026","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6295","display_name":"Michael Packard"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"79","name":"Bibles"},{"id":"139","name":"King James Version"}],"translators":[]}}}
