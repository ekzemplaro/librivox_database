{"books":{"52":{"id":"6420","title":"Geography and Plays","description":"Geography and Plays is a 1922 collection of Gertrude Stein's \"word portraits,\" or stream-of-consciousness writings. These stream-of-consciousness experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to Cubism, plasticity, and collage. Although the book has been described as \"a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all,\" it is considered to be one of Stein's seminal works.
