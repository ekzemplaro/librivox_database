In this, the first of the Grey House books, we are introduced to the three Grey sisters, Oswyth, 17, Roberta, 16 and 14 year old Prudence, their sensible and down-to-earth mother and dreamer of a father, an inventor with his head in the clouds. As we grow to know and love the family, their neighbors and relatives, a menacing cloud appears and the girls must rally to save the father they love from his own obstinacy.
