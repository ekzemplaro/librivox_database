{"books":{"22":{"id":"1836","title":"Montessori Method","description":"<p>In the early 1900's Dr. Maria Montessori began to reform educational methods with her work the 'Case dei Bambini' in Rome, Italy. Montessori began her work by developing methods to educate mentally retarded children, the method she developed was used with several children who at age eight took the state examinations in reading and writing, the children passed with above average scores. Because of this success (which is known as the 'first Montessori Miracle') Dr. Montessori was asked to open a school for children in Rome which she did. It was called the Case dei Bambini or \u201cChildren's House\u201d. Now 101 years after the opening of the first Children's House we have recorded the first English translation of \"The Montessori Method\" by Maria Montessori. This book explains the Montessori Method of Education which supports \u201cspontaneous self-development\u201d of children and is used in the Case dei Bambini as well as many many Montessori Schools through out the world. <\/p> <br>(Written by Shurtagal and Wikipedia)<\/br>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/digital.library.upenn.edu\/women\/montessori\/method\/method.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1912","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1836","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/montessori_method_0906_librivox\/montessori_method_0906_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-montessori-method-by-maria-montessori\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"11:51:49","totaltimesecs":42709,"authors":[{"id":"2454","first_name":"Maria","last_name":"Montessori","dob":"1870","dod":"1952"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/montessori_method_0906_librivox","sections":[{"id":"153243","section_number":"1","title":"A Critical Consideration of the New Pedagogy in Relation to Modern Science","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3163","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"153244","section_number":"2","title":"History of Methods","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2291","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"153245","section_number":"3","title":"Inaugural Address Delivered on the Occasion of the Opening of One of the \"Children's Houses\" ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2124","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2483","display_name":"Walter Holland"}]},{"id":"153246","section_number":"4","title":"Pedagogical Methods Used in the \"Children's Houses\"","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1458","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2669","display_name":"Eugene Fairfield"}]},{"id":"153247","section_number":"5","title":"Discipline","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2435","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1323","display_name":"Leon Mire"}]},{"id":"153248","section_number":"6","title":"How the Lesson Should be Given","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1154","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3340","display_name":"Preston McConkie"}]},{"id":"153249","section_number":"7","title":"Exercises of Practical Life","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"667","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1841","display_name":"Laura Caldwell"}]},{"id":"153250","section_number":"8","title":"Refection - The Child's Diet","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1213","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3820","display_name":"edp05mab"}]},{"id":"153251","section_number":"9","title":"Muscular Education - Gymnastics","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1303","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1084","display_name":"Nichole Karl"}]},{"id":"153252","section_number":"10","title":"Nature in Education - Agricultural Labour;
