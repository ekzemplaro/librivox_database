{"books":{"13":{"id":"5546","title":"Bible (KJV) 04: Numbers","description":"The Book of Numbers is the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible, and the fourth of five books of the Jewish Torah\/Pentateuch. This book may be divided into three parts:<br\/><br\/>\n\n   1. The numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations for resuming their march (1\u201310:10).<br\/>\n   2. An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the sending out of the spies and the report they brought back, the murmurings (eight times) of the people at the hardships by the way, and the subsequent exile into the wilderness for 40 years (10:11\u201321:20).<br\/>\n   3. The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing the Jordan River (21:21\u201336).<br\/><br\/>\n\nThe period comprehended in the history extends from the second month of the second year, as measured from the Exodus, to the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in all about thirty-seven years and nine months; a dreary period of wanderings.
