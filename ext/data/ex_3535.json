{"books":{"28":{"id":"3535","title":"Old-Time Makers of Medicine","description":"<p>Dr. Walsh's <i>Old-Time Makers of Medicine<\/i> chronicles the history and development of modern medicine from ancient times up to the discovery of America. Throughout this historical guide, Dr. Walsh shows numerous examples of practices thought to be entirely modern that were clearly anticipated hundreds or thousands of years ago. Ancient healers sought to use the body's natural healing ability, rather than rely exclusively on external cures. Physicians even in ancient times relied on what is now recognized as the placebo effect.<br \/><br \/>Dr. Walsh also addresses training and certification in medicine. Medieval universities anticipate our modern medical textbooks with consolidated records of all research and independent investigations, to provide uniform training for students. Likewise, the reader will find that the ancients reacted to unsuccessful treatment in similar degrees to what might now be called medical malpractice suits.<br \/><br \/>The book is organized chronologically, beginning with the fall of the Roman Empire and growth of the early Christian Church. From there, Dr. Walsh details the development of medical knowledge and practice in Arabia, to Medieval and Renaissance Europe. The reader will also discover how modern cultures based much of their medical knowledge on ancient Greek teachings. The chapters on Arabian Physicians and Medieval Universities also discuss knowledge exchanged between Arabic and European cultures. Dr. Walsh exposes several misconceptions and misinterpretations of history, especially restrictions of medical research stemming from religious prohibitions.
