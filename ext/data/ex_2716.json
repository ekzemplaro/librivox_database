If in the last story of \"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, gentleman-burglar\" Sherlock Holmes arrives too late (the name was at a later date changed to Herlock Sholmes in reply to complaints and threats by Conan Doyle regarding copyrights), in the two stories that compose \"The Blonde Lady\" these two great intellects are bound in opposite directions. Where one chooses to abide to the law, the other uses his power and wits to crime - and who is going to win?<\/p> <p>These two stories appeared in chapters and as separate pieces in the magazine <em>Je Sais Tout<\/em>, during the years of 1906 and 1907, and were published together as a book first in 1908, being the second of the books where Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, the kind-hearted and humorous thief, is the main character. <\/p><p>(Summary by Leni) <\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/24839","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2716","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/theblondelady_lrl_0904_librivox\/theblondelady_lrl_0904_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-blonde-lady-by-maurice-leblanc-0904\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:43:59","totaltimesecs":24239,"authors":[{"id":"2350","first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"Leblanc","dob":"1864","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/theblondelady_lrl_0904_librivox","sections":[{"id":"171178","section_number":"1","title":"1 - Number 514, Series 53","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3317","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171179","section_number":"2","title":"2 - The Blue Diamond","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2917","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171180","section_number":"3","title":"3 - Holmlock Shears Opens Hostilities","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2663","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171181","section_number":"4","title":"4 - A Glimmer in the Darkness","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2476","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171182","section_number":"5","title":"5 - Kidnapped","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2949","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171183","section_number":"6","title":"6 - The Second Arrest of Arsene Lupin","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2900","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171184","section_number":"7","title":"7 - The Jewish Lamp, part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2067","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171185","section_number":"8","title":"8 - The Jewish Lamp, part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2052","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]},{"id":"171186","section_number":"9","title":"9 - The Jewish Lamp, part 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2898","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2961","display_name":"Leni"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"5","name":"Crime & Mystery Fiction"}],"translators":[{"id":"6493","first_name":" Alexander","last_name":"Teixeira de Mattos","dob":"1865","dod":"1921"}]}}}
