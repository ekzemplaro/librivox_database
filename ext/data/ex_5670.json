{"books":{"22":{"id":"5670","title":"Mystery of the Locks","description":"Davy's Bend was a dying, lonely, uncared for river town. So when a stranger showed up one day and bought the old unoccupied house called 'The Locks' one dreary day, the inhabitants of the town were naturally very curious about the stranger, and very curious about his reasons for buying the old house. The Locks had been known for years to display at nighttime a single light showing up in one room, and there was one room in the house which was strictly off-limits to anyone. What was the history behind The Locks that nobody dared to talk about? What was the reason for the stranger's unannounced arrival and purchase of The Locks? Small, dying towns tend to keep their secrets to themselves, and Davy's Bend was no exception. Nor was the stranger's.
