The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes to Doctor Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his \"study in scarlet\": \"There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.\"  (A \"study\" is a preliminary drawing, sketch or painting done in preparation for a finished piece.)\n - Summary by David Clarke","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/244","language":"English","copyright_year":"1887","num_sections":"14","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9379","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Study_in_Scarlet","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"467","first_name":"Sir Arthur Conan","last_name":"Doyle","dob":"1859","dod":"1930"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"324966","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324967","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324968","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324969","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324970","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324971","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324972","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324973","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324974","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324975","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324976","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324977","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324978","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]},{"id":"324979","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7408","display_name":"David Clarke"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"5","name":"Crime & Mystery Fiction"},{"id":"22","name":"Detective Fiction"},{"id":"53","name":"Published 1800 -1900"}],"translators":[]}}}
