Born to a poor family, Brenner grew up in grinding povery. Brenner immigrated to Palestine (then part of the Ottoman Empire) in 1909. He worked as a farmer, eager to put his Zionist idelogy into practice. Later he devoted himself to literature and teaching at the Gymnasia Herzliya in Tel Aviv. He was murdered in southern Tel Aviv in May 1921 in the course of the anti-Jewish Arab riots known as the \"massacres of 1921\". Brenner was very much an \"experimental\" writer, both in his use of language and in literary form. With Modern Hebrew still in its infancy, Brenner improvised with an intruiging mixture of Hebrew, Aramaic, Yiddish, English and Arabic. In his attempt to portray life realistically, his work is full of emotive punctuation and ellipses. Out Of A Gloomy Valley was his first book pulished in Warsaw 1900.  It is a collection of 6 short stories about Jewish life in the diaspora.
