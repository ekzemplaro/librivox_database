{"books":{"18":{"id":"4819","title":"Our Mr. Wrenn, the Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man","description":"<p>\"At thirty-four Mr. Wrenn was the sales-entry clerk of the Souvenir Company. He was always bending over bills and columns of figures at a desk behind the stock-room. He was a meek little bachelor--a person of inconspicuous blue ready-made suits, and a small unsuccessful mustache.\" Mr. Wrenn, however has a rich inner life embellished by his own imagination. When he comes into a modest inheritance, he feels he ought to learn to get out and wander a bit, and then his education begins. He finds life more \"interesting\", perhaps than he had \"imagined\". . .
