This is the second volume. Initially serialized in weekly installments, they were the forerunners of today's soap operas. Known as \"Penny Dreadfuls\", they had no claim to literary brilliance but offered readers entertainment and excitement in the form of  vice, poverty, wealth, virtue, mystery and scandal in every combination and reached a mass audience. - Summary by Lynne Thompson","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/51294","language":"English","copyright_year":"1846","num_sections":"124","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10682","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Mysteries_of_London","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"4796","first_name":" George W.
