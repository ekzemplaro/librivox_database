{"books":{"28":{"id":"5412","title":"Treasury of David, Vol. 2 (Abridged)","description":"Charles Spurgeon was a British Particular Baptist preacher who remains highly influential among Christians of different denominations, among whom he is still known as the \"Prince of Preachers\". In his lifetime, Spurgeon preached to around 10,000,000 people, often up to 10 times each week at different places. He was the pastor of the congregation of the New Park Street Chapel (later the Metropolitan Tabernacle) in London for 38 years.<br><br>\n\nSpurgeon was a prolific author of many types of works. His accessible commentaries on the Psalms are a combination of meditation and teaching and are appropriate for anyone wanting to understand these familiar poems on a deeper level. In this second volume, LibriVox volunteers bring you reflections on Psalms 27 to Psalm 52.
