{"books":{"3":{"id":"10900","title":"Penal Cluster","description":"What do you do with telepaths?  Chain them to an asteroid of course and just leave them there ..... but why?  Wait a minute ... did I just say that the punishment for being a telepath in the future earth was to be chained to an asteroid 50 million miles from earth and then leave them there, comatose, to spin forever in their lonely orbits?   Well, yes, that is what earth's draconian solution was to the sudden emergence of telepath ability.  The world wide psychodeviant police had the job of tracking down these terrible deviants and then sending them into space immediately.  But are all telepaths evil?  Could one of these psychodeviant police be  secret telepath himself?  Listen to this great story and find out why earth felt so terrified of telepahts.   - Summary by philip a chenevert<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/25061","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"4","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10900","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox\/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-penal-cluster-by-randall-garrett\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"02:09:14","totaltimesecs":7754,"authors":[{"id":"6276","first_name":"Randall","last_name":"Garrett","dob":"1927","dod":"1987"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox","sections":[{"id":"371145","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/penalcluster_01_garrett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2175","file_name":"thepenalcluster_01_garrett_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"371146","section_number":"2","title":"Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/penalcluster_02_garrett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1988","file_name":"thepenalcluster_02_garrett_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"371147","section_number":"3","title":"Part 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/penalcluster_03_garrett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1744","file_name":"thepenalcluster_03_garrett_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"371148","section_number":"4","title":"Part 4","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/penalcluster_04_garrett_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1847","file_name":"thepenalcluster_04_garrett_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"30","name":"Science Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
