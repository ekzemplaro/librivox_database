{"books":{"55":{"id":"3437","title":"History of the Life of the Late Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great","description":"<p>This novel is sometimes thought of as [Fielding's] first because he almost certainly began composing it before he wrote Shamela and Joseph Andrews. It is a satire of Walpole that draws a parallel between Walpole and Jonathan Wild, the infamous gang leader and highwayman. He implicitly compares the Whig party in Parliament with a gang of thieves being run by Walpole, whose constant desire to be a \"Great Man\" (a common epithet for Walpole) should culminate only in the antithesis of greatness: being hanged.
