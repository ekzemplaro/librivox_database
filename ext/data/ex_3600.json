{"books":{"16":{"id":"3600","title":"Ghosts of Piccadilly","description":"Nothing spooky or supernatural, but a very personal gathering of gossip, letters, and fragments of biography of famous people who have lived in Piccadilly (in London, England) ... and of some of the buildings, now long gone.\r\n\r\n\"If any part of any city deserves a book to itself, it is Piccadilly. We shall stand before some house in the hours when the traffic is stilled, and I shall tell of its history, of the men and women who dwelt there, and talked and loved and gambled and lived and died. I shall follow the lines of my temperament and tastes rather than those of completeness and impartiality: it is likely that I shall be voluble about Byron and reticent about Macaulay.\"\r\n(From the preface) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/ghostsofpiccadil00streuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"17","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3600","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/ghostsofpiccadilly_1004_librivox\/ghostsofpiccadilly_1004_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-ghosts-of-piccadilly-by-g-s-street\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:47:59","totaltimesecs":20879,"authors":[{"id":"764","first_name":"G.
