{"books":{"20":{"id":"7895","title":"Bindle","description":"Herbert Jenkins' most popular fictional creation was Mr. Joseph Bindle, who first appeared in a humorous novel in 1916 and in a number of sequels. In the preface to the books, T. P. O'Connor said that \"Bindle is the greatest Cockney that has come into being through the medium of literature since Dickens wrote Pickwick Papers\". The stories are based on the comedic drama of life at work, at home and all the adventures that take place along the way. Bindle leaves a path of good-natured destruction behind him and walks away unscathed every time. He is not above embellishing and loves the joke. He refers to jokes as the anesthetic that allows him to endure the operation of life. When he sets about fixing things, they had better well stay fixed or they'll have him to deal with. Indeed, he is a sort of superhero of the Everyman. Let the hilarity begin!
