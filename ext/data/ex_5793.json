{"books":{"23":{"id":"5793","title":"Memoirs of a Revolutionist, Vol. 1","description":"Peter Kropotkin was a Russian anarcho-communist and scientist. This is his autobiography, and he writes not only about his own life, but also about 19th century Russian society and politics. He was born into the nobility and had a military education, but he gradually abandoned the values of his social class and became an anti-authoritarian socialist, opposed to both the rule of the Tsars and to the seizing of power by the authoritarian Bolsheviks. He was also interested in literature, biology, economics and geographical exploration. This first volume of his memoirs covers his childhood, his education, and the time he spent in Siberia.(Introduction by Elin)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/memoirsofrevolut01kropuoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1899","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5793","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/memoirs_revolutionist_1109_librivox\/memoirs_revolutionist_1109_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/memoirs-of-a-revolutionist-volume-1-by-peter-kropotkin\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:31:29","totaltimesecs":27089,"authors":[{"id":"2278","first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Kropotkin","dob":"1842","dod":"1921"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/memoirs_revolutionist_1109_librivox","sections":[{"id":"73650","section_number":"0","title":"00 -
