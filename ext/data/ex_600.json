{"books":{"7":{"id":"600","title":"Awakening","description":"<p>Owing to its highly personal content focused on feminine sexuality, this LibriVox edition was recorded by eight female readers. <br><br>\n\nThe Modern Library edition of The Awakening has an introduction by Kay Gibbons, who writes: \u201cThe Awakening shocked turn-of-the-century readers with its forthright treatment of sex and suicide. Departing from literary convention, Kate Chopin failed to condemn her heroine\u2019s desire for an affair with the son of a Louisiana resort owner, whom she meets on vacation. The power of sensuality, the delusion of ecstatic love, and the solitude that accompanies the trappings of middle- and upper-class life are the themes of this now-classic novel.\u201d \u2013 As Kay Gibbons points out, Chopin \u201cwas writing American realism before most Americans could bear to hear that they were living it.\u201d<br><br>\n\nTo give you an idea of the subject matter, Project Gutenburg catalogues The Awakening under \"Adultery -- Fiction -- Women -- Louisiana -- New Orleans -- Social conditions.
