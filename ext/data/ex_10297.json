{"books":{"11":{"id":"10297","title":"Jeremy","description":"With affectionate humor, Mr. Walpole tells the story of Jeremy and his two sisters, Helen and Mary Cole, who grow up in Polchester, a quiet English Cathedral town. There is the Jampot, who is the nurse ; Hamlet, the stray dog ; Uncle Samuel, who paints pictures and is altogether 'queer\u2019; of course, Mr. and Mrs. Cole, and Aunt Amy. Mr. Walpole has given his narrative a rare double appeal, for it not only recreates for the adult the illusion of his own happiest youth, but it unfolds for the child-reader a genuine and moving experience with real people and pleasant things. No child will fail to love the birthday in the Cole household, the joyous departure for the sea and the country in the long vacation. ( Joseph Hergesheimer, Hugh Walpole: An Appreciation, 1919, p 38 and david wales)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/3474","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10297","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/jeremy_dw_1511_librivox\/jeremy_dw_1511_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/jeremy-by-hugh-walpole\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"09:03:22","totaltimesecs":32602,"authors":[{"id":"3387","first_name":"Hugh","last_name":"Walpole","dob":"1884","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/jeremy_dw_1511_librivox","sections":[{"id":"352575","section_number":"1","title":"Ch 1  The Birthday","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_01_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2809","file_name":"jeremy_01_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352576","section_number":"2","title":"Ch 2  The Family Dog","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_02_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2457","file_name":"jeremy_02_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352577","section_number":"3","title":"Ch 3  Christmas Pantomime","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_03_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3125","file_name":"jeremy_03_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352578","section_number":"4","title":"Ch 4  Miss Jones","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_04_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2899","file_name":"jeremy_04_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352579","section_number":"5","title":"Ch 5  The Sea-Captain","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_05_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2663","file_name":"jeremy_05_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352580","section_number":"6","title":"Ch 6  Family Pride","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_06_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2420","file_name":"jeremy_06_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352581","section_number":"7","title":"Ch 7  Religion","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_07_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2512","file_name":"jeremy_07_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352582","section_number":"8","title":"Ch 8  To Cow Farm!","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_08_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2602","file_name":"jeremy_08_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352583","section_number":"9","title":"Ch 9  The Awakening Of Charlotte","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_09_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2942","file_name":"jeremy_09_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352584","section_number":"10","title":"Ch 10 Mary","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_10_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2955","file_name":"jeremy_10_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352585","section_number":"11","title":"Ch 11 The Merry-Go-Round","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_11_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"3210","file_name":"jeremy_11_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"352586","section_number":"12","title":"Ch 12 Hamlet Waits","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/jeremy_12_walpole_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"2008","file_name":"jeremy_12_walpole_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"40","name":"Family"}],"translators":[]}}}
