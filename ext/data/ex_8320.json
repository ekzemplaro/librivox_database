{"books":{"2":{"id":"8320","title":"Little Mermaid","description":"The Little Mermaid\" (Danish: Den lille havfrue, literally: \"the little sea lady\") is a very well known fairy tale by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen about a young mermaid willing to give up her life in the sea and her identity as a mermaid to gain a human soul and the love of a human prince. The tale was first published in 1837 and has been adapted to various media including musical theatre and animated film.  But this tale is not the Disney version, all cleaned up and made pretty.  This is the way Andersen wrote it.  The Little Mermaid is indeed at the happy wedding of her beloved prince, but she is not the bride.  And then she becomes a big bubble.  Curious? Listen and find out what happens.    - Summary by Wikipedia and Phil Chenevert","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/17860","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8320","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/thelittlemermaid_1310_librivox\/thelittlemermaid_1310_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Little_Mermaid","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-little-mermaid-by-hans-christian-andersen\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"01:01:57","totaltimesecs":3717,"authors":[{"id":"122","first_name":"Hans Christian","last_name":"Andersen","dob":"1805","dod":"1875"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/thelittlemermaid_1310_librivox","sections":[{"id":"296990","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/littlemermaid_1_andersen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1280","file_name":"littlemermaid_01_andersen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"296991","section_number":"2","title":"Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/littlemermaid_2_andersen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1446","file_name":"littlemermaid_02_andersen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]},{"id":"296992","section_number":"3","title":"Part 3","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/littlemermaid_3_andersen_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"991","file_name":"littlemermaid_03_andersen_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"5717","display_name":"Phil Chenevert"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"39","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
