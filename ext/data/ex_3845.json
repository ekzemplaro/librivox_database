{"books":{"10":{"id":"3845","title":"Experiments on Plant Hybridisation","description":"<p>Gregor Mendel was an Augustinian monk in the St. Thomas monastery in Brno. His seminal paper \"Experiments on Plant Hybridization\" presents his results of studying genetic traits in pea plants. It is the ground breaking work on inheritance, being the first to differentiate between dominant and recessive genetic traits. His work was long ignored and deemed controversial, however, at its rediscovery at the turn to the 20th century, it earned Gregor Mendel the title \"father of modern genetics\".
