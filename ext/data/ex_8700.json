{"books":{"32":{"id":"8700","title":"History of American Christianity","description":"Bacon introduced his History of American Christianity at the very end of the 19th century. The book appeared just after the violence and controversy of the American Civil War, and just as that of racial segregation and the World Wars began to brew. In spite of this, Bacon\u2019s History highlights the glories and triumphs of Christianity\u2019s development in the United States. In particular, he focuses on how all kinds of Christians from many different countries have met and come together in America. He looks forward to a future in which these Christians can live united in faith. While some critique Bacon\u2019s History for its perhaps excessive patriotism, others appreciate Bacon\u2019s ecumenical vision. In any case, the book stands in a rather unique place in American history. By virtue of this, it tells the story of American Christianity in a way particularly refreshing for an American era characterized by the political polarization of the church.  - Summary by Kathleen
