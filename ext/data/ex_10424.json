{"books":{"9":{"id":"10424","title":"Charm","description":"To all who knew him, the man himself was at least as important as his work. \"As to his talk\" \u2014 I quote again from Mr. Somerset \u2014 \"he was a spendthrift. I mean that he never saved anything up as those writer fellows so often do. He was quite inconsequent and just rippled on, but was always ready to attack a careless thinker. On the other hand, he was extremely tolerant of fools, even bad poets who are the worst kind of fools \u2014 or rather the hardest to bear \u2014 but that was kindness of heart.\"\nOf his personal appearance a good deal has been said. \"One who knew him,\" writing in one of the daily papers, said that \"to look at, he was part of the youth of the world. He was one of the handsomest Englishmen of his time. His moods seemed to be merely a disguise for the radiance of an early summer's day.\" (From Rupert Brooke: A Biographical Note by Margaret Lavington in THE COLLECTED POEMS OF RUPERT BROOKE, (from which this poem is taken.)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/262","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10424","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/the_charm_1511.poem_librivox\/the_charm_1511.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-charm-by-rupert-brooke\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:18:40","totaltimesecs":1120,"authors":[{"id":"716","first_name":"Rupert","last_name":"Brooke","dob":"1887","dod":"1915"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/the_charm_1511.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"356682","section_number":"1","title":"The Charm - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"108","file_name":"charm_brooke_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"356676","section_number":"2","title":"The Charm - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"130","file_name":"charm_brooke_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"356679","section_number":"3","title":"The Charm - Read by BSD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_bsd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"104","file_name":"charm_brooke_bsd_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10402","display_name":"Brian Darby"}]},{"id":"356680","section_number":"4","title":"The Charm - Read by CAM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_cam_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"109","file_name":"charm_brooke_cam_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10177","display_name":"millianna"}]},{"id":"356681","section_number":"5","title":"The Charm - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"101","file_name":"charm_brooke_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"356675","section_number":"6","title":"The Charm - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"109","file_name":"charm_brooke_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"356673","section_number":"7","title":"The Charm - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"130","file_name":"charm_brooke_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"356674","section_number":"8","title":"The Charm - Read by JM","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/charm_brooke_jm_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"97","file_name":"charm_brooke_jm_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9902","display_name":"J.
