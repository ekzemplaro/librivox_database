{"books":{"2":{"id":"276","title":"Eve\u2019s Diary","description":"<p>    Eve\u2019s Diary is a humorous monologue about Eve\u2019s experiences at the dawn of creation. She is fascinated by every aspect of the new world around her and\u2026 Adam! The following is an extract from Adam:\n\n    \u201cShe is all interest, eagerness, vivacity, the world is to her a charm, a wonder, a mystery, a joy; she can\u2019t speak for delight when she finds a new flower, she must pet it and caress it and smell it and talk to it\u2026. And she is color-mad: brown rocks, yellow sand, gray moss, green foliage, blue sky\u2026none of them is of any practical value, so far as I can see, but because they have color and majesty, that is enough for her, and she loses her mind over them\u2026. If there is anything on the planet that she is not interested in, it is not in my list.\u201d\n\n    (Summary by Esther Lockwood) <\/p> \n\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/8525","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"3","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/276","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/eves_diary_librivox\/eves_diary_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/eves-diary-by-mark-twain\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:38:03","totaltimesecs":2283,"authors":[{"id":"9","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Twain","dob":"1835","dod":"1910"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/eves_diary_librivox","sections":[{"id":"124468","section_number":"1","title":"Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"731","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"205","display_name":"Esther"}]},{"id":"124469","section_number":"2","title":"Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"637","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"205","display_name":"Esther"}]},{"id":"124470","section_number":"3","title":"Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"915","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"205","display_name":"Esther"},{"reader_id":"874","display_name":"Mike Lockwood"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"19","name":"Humorous Fiction"},{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"}],"translators":[]}}}
