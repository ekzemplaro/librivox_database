Can he stop their fiendish plan, and keep America safe for shallow judgements based on status symbols?\n\nStatus Quo was nominated for the 1962 Hugo Award for short fiction. - Summary by Peter Eastman","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30339","language":"English","copyright_year":"1961","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9494","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/status_quo_1503_librivox\/status_quo_1503_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"03:09:40","totaltimesecs":11380,"authors":[{"id":"57","first_name":"Dallas McCord","last_name":"Reynolds","dob":"1917","dod":"1983"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/status_quo_1503_librivox","sections":[{"id":"334313","section_number":"1","title":"section 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1866","file_name":"status_quo_01_reynolds_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"174","display_name":"Peter Eastman"}]},{"id":"334314","section_number":"2","title":"section 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1991","file_name":"status_quo_02_reynolds_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"174","display_name":"Peter Eastman"}]},{"id":"334315","section_number":"3","title":"section 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1821","file_name":"status_quo_03_reynolds_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"174","display_name":"Peter Eastman"}]},{"id":"334316","section_number":"4","title":"section 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1901","file_name":"status_quo_04_reynolds_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"174","display_name":"Peter Eastman"}]},{"id":"334317","section_number":"5","title":"section 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1873","file_name":"status_quo_05_reynolds_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"174","display_name":"Peter Eastman"}]},{"id":"334318","section_number":"6","title":"section 6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1928","file_name":"status_quo_06_reynolds_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"174","display_name":"Peter Eastman"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"3","name":"Action & Adventure Fiction"},{"id":"30","name":"Science Fiction"},{"id":"33","name":"Suspense, Espionage, Political & Thrillers"}],"translators":[]}}}
