{"books":{"12":{"id":"10737","title":"In Spring","description":"Aline Murray Kilmer (August 1, 1888 \u2013 October 1, 1941), was an American poet, children's book author, and essayist, and the wife and widow of poet and journalist Joyce Kilmer (1886-1918).\n\nAline attended the Rutgers College Preparatory School with her husband, Alfred Joyce Kilmer and married him soon after his graduation from Columbia University in 1908. In their short marriage, lasting 10 years, her husband had achieved fame as a poet, literary critic and among Catholic circles as America's most prominent Catholic writer. After his death in World War I, Aline began publishing her own poetry and a few children's books. Today, her work is largely forgotten. - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.theotherpages.org\/poems\/books\/kilmer\/kilmer05.html#spring","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10737","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox\/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/in-spring-by-aline-kilmer\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:11:37","totaltimesecs":697,"authors":[{"id":"9388","first_name":"Aline","last_name":"Kilmer","dob":"1888","dod":"1941"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"365891","section_number":"1","title":"In Spring - Read by ACD","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_acd_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"36","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_acd_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10717","display_name":"Saffie"}]},{"id":"365894","section_number":"2","title":"In Spring - Read by ALP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_alp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"52","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_alp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"365900","section_number":"3","title":"In Spring - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"60","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"365897","section_number":"4","title":"In Spring - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"48","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"365890","section_number":"5","title":"In Spring - Read by EL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_el_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"57","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_el_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9872","display_name":"Newgatenovelist"}]},{"id":"365892","section_number":"6","title":"In Spring - Read by GG","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_gg_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"63","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_gg_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"365898","section_number":"7","title":"In Spring - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"59","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"365893","section_number":"8","title":"In Spring - Read by JEF","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_jef_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"53","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_jef_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10494","display_name":"Jennifer Fournier"}]},{"id":"365889","section_number":"9","title":"In Spring - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"49","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_lah_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"365895","section_number":"10","title":"In Spring - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"60","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"365896","section_number":"11","title":"In Spring - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"59","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"365901","section_number":"12","title":"In Spring - Read by SS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_ss_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"55","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_ss_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"9123","display_name":"Shakira Searle"}]},{"id":"365899","section_number":"13","title":"In Spring - Read by T","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/inspring_kilmer_t_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"46","file_name":"inspring_kilmer_t_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10615","display_name":"Twinkle"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
