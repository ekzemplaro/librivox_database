She was most notable for her series of novels featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel. <br \/><br \/><em>Castles in the Air<\/em>, a short novel or perhaps more like a collection of short stories with memories of a French rogue in the early 19th century Paris, was published in 1921 and about it I quote from the foreword: \"In very truth my good friend Ratichon is an unblushing liar, thief, a forger--anything you will; his vanity is past belief, his scruples are non-existent. How he escaped a convict settlement it is difficult to imagine, and hard to realize that he died--presumably some years after the event recorded in the last chapter of his autobiography--a respected member of the community, honoured by that same society which should have raised a punitive hand against him.\" (Summary by Wikipedia, Lars Rolander and Emma Orczy)<br \/><br \/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/12461","language":"English","copyright_year":"1921","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3085","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox\/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/castles-in-the-air-by-baroness-emmuska-orczy\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:44.23","totaltimesecs":464.23,"authors":[{"id":"1256","first_name":"Baroness","last_name":"Orczy","dob":"1865","dod":"1947"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox","sections":[{"id":"179199","section_number":"0","title":"Foreword","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"335","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179200","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I - A Roland for his Oliver Pt 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1670","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179201","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter I - A Roland for his Oliver Pt 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2160","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179202","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter II - A Fool's Paradise Pt 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1583","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179203","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter II - A Fool's Paradise Pt 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1350","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179204","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter III - On the Brink Pt 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1965","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179205","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter III - On the Brink Pt 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2713","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179206","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter IV - Carissimo Pt 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1683","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179207","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter IV - Carissimo Pt 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1640","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179208","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter IV - Carissimo Pt 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"950","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179209","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter V - The Toys Pt 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2070","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179210","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter V - The Toys Pt 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2633","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179211","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter VI - Honour among ----- Pt 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1827","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179212","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter VI - Honour among ----- Pt 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1493","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179213","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter VII - An Over-sensitive Heart Pt 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1550","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]},{"id":"179214","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter VII - An Over-sensitive Heart Pt 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2246","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2234","display_name":"Lars Rolander"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"},{"id":"31","name":"Short Stories"}],"translators":[]}}}
