{"books":{"21":{"id":"4360","title":"Wizard","description":"<P>Described by the author, best known for his King Solomon's Mines, as \"a tale of victorious faith,\" this story begins on a Sunday afternoon in an English church. Most of the book, though, is set in Africa, and the adventure story is as engaging as any of Haggard's African tales. What makes this one different is the religious question: What has happened to miracles in the church? Is there any power left in Jesus' promise, \"Whoso that believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also, and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do\"?<\/P>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2893","language":"English","copyright_year":"1896","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4360","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/wizard_1011_librivox\/wizard_1011_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-wizard-by-h-rider-haggard\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"5:49:03","totaltimesecs":20943,"authors":[{"id":"171","first_name":"H.
