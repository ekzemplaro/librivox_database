{"books":{"18":{"id":"341","title":"Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins","description":"Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844\u201389) was an English poet, educated at Oxford. Entering the Roman Catholic Church in 1866 and the Jesuit novitiate in 1868, he was ordained in 1877. Upon becoming a Jesuit he burned much of his early verse and abandoned the writing of poetry. However, the sinking in 1875 of a German ship carrying five Franciscan nuns, exiles from Germany, inspired him to write one of his most impressive poems \u201cThe Wreck of the Deutschland.\u201d Thereafter he produced his best poetry, including \u201cGod\u2019s Grandeur,\u201d \u201cThe Windhover,\u201d \u201cThe Leaden Echo,\u201d and \u201cThe Golden Echo.\u201d  (Summary by Bartleby)<br \/>Editor: Robert S.
