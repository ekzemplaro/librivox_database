{"books":{"15":{"id":"368","title":"Prince","description":"<p><i>ll Principe<\/i> (The Prince) is a political treatise by the Florentine writer Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, originally called \u201cDe Principatibus\u201d (About Principalities). It was written around 1513, but not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli\u2019s death. The treatise is not actually representative of his published work during his lifetime, but it is certainly the best remembered one.\n(Summary from Wikipedia.org)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1232","language":"English","copyright_year":"1908","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/368","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/prince_librivox\/prince_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Prince","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-prince-by-niccolo-machiavelli\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"05:54:34","totaltimesecs":21274,"authors":[{"id":"885","first_name":"Niccol\u00f2","last_name":"Machiavelli","dob":"1469","dod":"1527"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/prince_librivox","sections":[{"id":"126083","section_number":"1","title":"Translator ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1112","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"126084","section_number":"2","title":"The Man and His Work","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"740","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"126085","section_number":"3","title":"Author","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"211","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"126086","section_number":"4","title":"Ch. 01-03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1388","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"14","display_name":"Kristin LeMoine"}]},{"id":"126087","section_number":"5","title":"Ch. 04-06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1145","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"126088","section_number":"6","title":"Ch. 07-08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1845","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"126089","section_number":"7","title":"Ch. 09-11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1281","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"126090","section_number":"8","title":"Ch. 12-13","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1451","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"14","display_name":"Kristin LeMoine"}]},{"id":"126091","section_number":"9","title":"Ch. 14-16","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1005","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"19","display_name":"Kara Shallenberg"}]},{"id":"126092","section_number":"10","title":"Ch. 17-18","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"982","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"78","display_name":"Hugh McGuire"}]},{"id":"126093","section_number":"11","title":"Ch. 19 ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1626","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"126094","section_number":"12","title":"Ch. 20-22","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1428","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"126095","section_number":"13","title":"Ch. 23-26","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1882","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"25","display_name":"John Gonzalez"}]},{"id":"126096","section_number":"14","title":"Appendix 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"961","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"126097","section_number":"15","title":"The Life Of Castruccio Castracani Of Lucca ","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1718","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]},{"id":"126098","section_number":"16","title":"The Life Of Castruccio Castracani Of Lucca","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2499","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"36","display_name":"Chip"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"}],"translators":[{"id":"6932","first_name":" William K.","last_name":"Marriott","dob":"","dod":""}]}}}
