{"books":{"14":{"id":"5236","title":"Meditations from the Pen of Mrs. Maria W. Stewart","description":"<br \/>Maria W. Stewart was America's first black woman political writer.  Between 1831 and 1833, she gave four speeches on the topics of slavery and women's rights.  <em>Meditations From The Pen of Mrs. Maria W. Stewart<\/em>\u2014published in 1879, shortly before her death\u2014is a collection of those speeches as well as her memoir, some meditations and prayers.  They are political, poetical and sermon all at the same time; but in the mileu in which she lectured, they were a critically important part of the abolitionist movement years before the contributions of others such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth.  Her speeches and essays espoused a return to Christian values and morality, but also proposed fundamental changes in gender roles in the midst of tremendous public opposition to the rights of blacks and of women.
