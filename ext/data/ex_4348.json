{"books":{"2":{"id":"4348","title":"Little Eyolf","description":"<p>Henrik Ibsen's 1894 play <i>Little Eyolf<\/i> tells the story of the Allmers family: the father, Alfred, his wife Rita, their crippled nine-year-old son Eyolf, and Alfred's sister Asta.  As the play begins, Alfred has just gotten back from a trip to the mountains, and resolves to spend more time with his son, rather than on intellectual pursuits.  Asta is romantically pursued by Borgheim, an engineer, while the cracks in Alfred and Rita's marriage gradually reveal themselves.  The family receives a visit from the Rat-Wife, and are never the same again.
