{"books":{"23":{"id":"9648","title":"Story Of A Modern Woman","description":"\"This touching short novel tells the story of Mary Earl, a woman who has to fend for herself in London at the end of the 19th century. She becomes a writer. But she cannot write whatever she wants. There is a format in which her novels should be written- a format she does not like or understand. To make matters worse, she falls in love with a married man. This novel is considered one of the best, and most touching, new woman novels, as it highlights many of the difficulties a single woman faced at the end of the 19th century. The writing is vivid. You can just sit back and let it get into your heart.\" - Summary by Stav Nisser","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/storyamodernwom01dixogoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1894","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9648","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/the_story_of_a_modern_woman","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11225","first_name":"Ella Hepworth","last_name":"Dixon","dob":"1857","dod":"1932"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"332775","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1: An end and a beginning","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"688","display_name":"J.
