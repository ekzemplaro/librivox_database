{"books":{"23":{"id":"9648","title":"Story Of A Modern Woman","description":"\"This touching short novel tells the story of Mary Earl, a woman who has to fend for herself in London at the end of the 19th century. She becomes a writer. But she cannot write whatever she wants. There is a format in which her novels should be written- a format she does not like or understand. To make matters worse, she falls in love with a married man. This novel is considered one of the best, and most touching, new woman novels, as it highlights many of the difficulties a single woman faced at the end of the 19th century. The writing is vivid. You can just sit back and let it get into your heart.\" - Summary by Stav Nisser","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/storyamodernwom01dixogoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1894","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9648","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/the_story_of_a_modern_woman","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11225","first_name":"Ella Hepworth","last_name":"Dixon","dob":"1857","dod":"1932"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"332775","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter 1: An end and a beginning","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332776","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter 2: A Child","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332777","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter 3: A Young Girl","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332778","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter 4: Alison","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332779","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter 5: Mary's Lover","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332780","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter 6: THE Central London School of Art","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332781","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter 7: A KETTLEDRUM AT LADY JANE'S","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332782","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter 8: Mary Trys To Live Her Life","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332783","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter 9: PERRY CONSOLES","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332784","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter 10: In Grub Street","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332785","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter 11: The Woman Waits","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332786","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter 12: The Man Returns","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332787","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter 13: THE APOTHEOSIS OF PERRY JACKSON","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332788","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter 14: MARY GOES OUT ON A WET DAY","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332789","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter 15: A COMEDY IN REAL LIFE","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332790","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter 16: TWO ULTIMATUMS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332791","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter 17: NUMBER TWENTY-SEVEN","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332792","section_number":"18","title":"Chapter 18: DUNLOP STRANGE MAKES A MISTAKE","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332793","section_number":"19","title":"Chapter 19: ALISON ARRANGES A MATCH","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332794","section_number":"20","title":"Chapter 20: THE GATE OF SILENCE","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332795","section_number":"21","title":"Chapter 21: THE WORLD WAGS ON","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332796","section_number":"22","title":"Chapter 22: THE TEMPTATION","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332797","section_number":"23","title":"Chapter 23: THE WOMAN IN THE GLASS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"332798","section_number":"24","title":"Chapter 24: IN WHICH CIVILISATION TRIUMPHS","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[],"translators":[]}}}
