{"books":{"20":{"id":"9983","title":"American in the Making, the Life Story of an Immigrant","description":"\u201cThe sweat-shop was for me the cradle of liberty. . . It was my first university.\u201d Attending lectures and the New York theatre at night; by day sewing sleeves into shirts in a ghetto shop, Marcus Eli Ravage (1884-1965) began his transformation from \u201calien\u201d to American. His 1917 autobiography is a paean to the transformative power of education.  Ravage emigrated from Rumania in 1900, at the age of 16.  After working for several years as a \u201csleever\u201d to save money, he enrolls in the University of Missouri (the least expensive school he can find), where culture shock overwhelms him at first.  \u201cI was not sure whether it was a pig or a sheep that bleated, whether clover was a plant and plover a bird, or the other way around.\u201d  But he adapts, and eventually embraces \u201cthe bigger and freer world\u201d outside the immigrant ghetto.  He writes that, because of his university experience, he was no longer \u201ca man without a country.\u201d  He had become an American. - Summary by Sue
