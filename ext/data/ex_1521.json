{"books":{"18":{"id":"1521","title":"Holy Sonnets","description":"John Donne (1572 \u2013 March 31, 1631) was a Jacobean poet and preacher, representative of the metaphysical poets of the period. His works, notable for their realistic and sensual style, include sonnets, love poetry, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and immediacy of metaphor, compared with that of his contemporaries. Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death, and the fear that it inspired in many men, on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X, from which come the famous lines \u201cDeath, be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so.\u201d (Summary from Wikipedia) ","url_text_source":"http:\/\/cs1.mcm.edu\/~rayb\/holy_sonnets.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"19","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/1521","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox\/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/holy-sonnets-by-john-donne\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"0:23:47","totaltimesecs":1427,"authors":[{"id":"742","first_name":"John","last_name":"Donne","dob":"1572","dod":"1631"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox","sections":[{"id":"146536","section_number":"1","title":"Holy Sonnet I \u2013 Thou hast made me, and shall Thy work decay?","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"77","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"146537","section_number":"2","title":"Holy Sonnet II \u2013 As due by many titles I resign my self to Thee\u2026","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"73","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"146538","section_number":"3","title":"Holy Sonnet III \u2013 O might those sighs and tears return again\u2026","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"74","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"94","display_name":"David Barnes"}]},{"id":"146539","section_number":"4","title":"Holy Sonnet IV \u2013 Oh my black soul!
