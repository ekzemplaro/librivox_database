This was the Weekly Poetry project for September 23, 2012.<br><br>James McIntyre, born in Scotland, came to Canada in 1841. He finally settled in Ingersoll (a town in central Ontario on the banks of the Thames River), the then-heart of Canadian dairy country.<br>He was well loved in the community, from which he often received aid in hard times, due in part to his poesy and oratorical skills \u2014 he was called on to speak at every kind of social gathering in Ingersoll. The region seems to have inspired him, and it was in celebration of the proud history of Canada, the natural beauty and industry of the region, and especially its cheese, that the majority of his oeuvre was written.
