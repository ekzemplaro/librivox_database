{"books":{"5":{"id":"1788","title":"Pamphilia to Amphilanthus","description":"Pamphilia to Amphilanthus is the first sonnet sequence written by an Englishwoman. Published in 1621, the poems invert the usual format of sonnet sequences by making the speaker a woman (Pamphilia, whose name means \"all-loving\") and the beloved a man (Amphilanthus, whose name means \"lover of two.\"). It is possible that Wroth based the story on her own fraught relationship with her cousin, William Herbert.
