{"books":{"15":{"id":"4331","title":"Abandoned","description":"<p>We meet Miss Lucretia Lane as she is dressing for her marriage to Captain Francis Reynolds of the British Merchant Service. Though he loves her truly, she has severe misgivings. She goes through with the wedding in spite of this, but refuses to live with her new husband, and cannot be enticed or cajoled to do so. Then on the day the Captain is scheduled to ship out, she receives word that he has been gravely injured and his dying request is to see his wife. She flies to his side... and thus begins an adventure spanning eight years - love, loathing, shipwreck, love lost, and redemption. (Summary by P. Cunningham and Nadine Eckert-Boulet)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/abandoned00russgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1904","num_sections":"16","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4331","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/abandoned_1012_librivox\/abandoned_1012_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/abandoned-by-w-clark-russell\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"9:31:09","totaltimesecs":34269,"authors":[{"id":"771","first_name":"William Clark","last_name":"Russell","dob":"1844","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/abandoned_1012_librivox","sections":[{"id":"35221","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I, The Wedding","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1713","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4145","display_name":"Patti Cunningham"}]},{"id":"35222","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II, The Medical Certificate","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1678","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4145","display_name":"Patti Cunningham"}]},{"id":"35223","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III, Trapped","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2140","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3157","display_name":"TriciaG"}]},{"id":"35224","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV, A Change of Mind","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2051","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5616","display_name":"Anna Starzyk"}]},{"id":"35225","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter V, The Wreck","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2494","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5275","display_name":"Terence Taylor"}]},{"id":"35226","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter VI, The Fisherman","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2238","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4853","display_name":"Barbara Derksen"}]},{"id":"35227","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter VII, The Boat's Crew","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2000","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5545","display_name":"Gary Olman"}]},{"id":"35228","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter VIII, Conversations and Confidences","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1940","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5545","display_name":"Gary Olman"}]},{"id":"35229","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter IX, The Chase","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2095","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3967","display_name":"Christine Dufour"}]},{"id":"35230","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter X, Two Graves","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1921","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3967","display_name":"Christine Dufour"}]},{"id":"35231","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XI, The Chanticleer","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2394","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5720","display_name":"Thelma Meyer"}]},{"id":"35232","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter XII, After Eight Years","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1984","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5545","display_name":"Gary Olman"}]},{"id":"35233","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter XIII, At Ramsgate","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2083","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5679","display_name":"Joshua"}]},{"id":"35234","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter XIV, A Rescue","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2286","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3157","display_name":"TriciaG"}]},{"id":"35235","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter XV, Mr. Goodhart Offers Marriage","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2930","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2607","display_name":"Ruth Golding"}]},{"id":"35236","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter XVI, Husband and Wife","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2322","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5545","display_name":"Gary Olman"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"3","name":"Action & Adventure Fiction"},{"id":"15","name":"General Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
