{"books":{"27":{"id":"2410","title":"Invisible Links","description":"Selma Lagerl\u00f6f was born in Vaermland, Sweden, in 1858 and enjoyed a long and very successful career as a writer, receiving the Nobel-Price in Literature in 1909. She died in Vaermland in 1940. Invisible Links (Osynliga l\u00e4nkar) is a collection of short stories with an underlying theme about the links that influence and guide people\u2019s actions and lives. It was first published in 1894 and the English translation in 1895. The stories are often set in Lagerloef\u2019s Vaermland, but they also depict legends and history of Sweden, and some have connections to other works by Lagerloef. Invisible Links is a good introduction to the writings of Selma Lagerloef.
