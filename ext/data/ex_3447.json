{"books":{"22":{"id":"3447","title":"Song of Hiawatha","description":"<p>I sing the Song of Hiawatha,\nBrave of heart and strong of arm.\nDaughter's son of old Nokomis,\nFathered by the harsh West Wind.\n\nWith its regular, beating rhythm, the Song of Hiawatha has often been parodied, but in truth, it is a powerful, emotional epic; a hero's life, his loves and suffering. The legends and traditions of the North American Indian swirl together through the tale like a mountain stream, tumbling white over the rocks, and caressing the mossy tree roots.\n(Summary by Peter Yearsley)\n[introduction by Woodrow
