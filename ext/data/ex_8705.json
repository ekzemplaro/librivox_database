In the story, the young and snobbish daughter of a millionaire is about to marry the Duke of Charmerace, recently returned from a trip to the South Pole. However, things won't go as smoothly as expected for the spoiled girl and her faithful servant, mainly when Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, the famous gentleman-burglar appears where he is least expected!
