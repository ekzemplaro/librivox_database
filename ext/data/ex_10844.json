{"books":{"11":{"id":"10844","title":"Old Man Rain","description":"Madison Julius Cawein was born in Louisville, the fifth child of William and Christiana (Stelsly) Cawein. His father made patent medicines from herbs. Thus as a child, Cawein became acquainted with and developed a love for local nature.\nHis output was thirty-six books and 1,500 poems. His writing presented Kentucky scenes in a language echoing Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats.[5] He soon earned the nickname the \"Keats of Kentucky\".   - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.poemhunter.com\/best-poems\/madison-julius-cawein\/old-man-rain\/","language":"English","copyright_year":"0","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10844","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/old_man_rain_1605.poem_librivox\/old_man_rain_1605.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/old-man-rain-by-madison-cawein\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:15:42","totaltimesecs":942,"authors":[{"id":"22","first_name":"Madison","last_name":"Cawein","dob":"1865","dod":"1914"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/old_man_rain_1605.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"368805","section_number":"1","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by BK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_bk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"98","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_bk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8786","display_name":"Bruce Kachuk"}]},{"id":"368800","section_number":"2","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by BMH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_bmh_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"58","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_bmh_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10686","display_name":"Bridget Herbes"}]},{"id":"368806","section_number":"3","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by CAL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_cal_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"80","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_cal_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10665","display_name":"Christine Lehman"}]},{"id":"368801","section_number":"4","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by DL","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_dl_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"76","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_dl_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"2911","display_name":"David Lawrence"}]},{"id":"368804","section_number":"5","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by GB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_gb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"80","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_gb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4969","display_name":"Garth Burton"}]},{"id":"368807","section_number":"6","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by IK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_ik_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"68","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_ik_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"7785","display_name":"Ian King"}]},{"id":"368797","section_number":"7","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by LAH","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_lah_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"78","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_lah_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"1212","display_name":"Lee Ann Howlett"}]},{"id":"368796","section_number":"8","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by LIAN","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_lian_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"71","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_lian_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10763","display_name":"Lian Pang"}]},{"id":"368802","section_number":"9","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by LLW","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_llw_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"82","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_llw_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"4738","display_name":"Leonard Wilson"}]},{"id":"368803","section_number":"10","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by MK","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_mk_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"91","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_mk_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"8051","display_name":"Maria Kasper"}]},{"id":"368798","section_number":"11","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by NB","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_nb_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"82","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_nb_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"6965","display_name":"NoelBadrian"}]},{"id":"368799","section_number":"12","title":"Old Man Rain - Read by TP","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/aradlaw\/oldmanrain_cawein_tp_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"78","file_name":"oldmanrain_cawein_tp_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"10789","display_name":"Tomas Peter"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"71","name":"Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"}],"translators":[]}}}
