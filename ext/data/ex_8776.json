{"books":{"10":{"id":"8776","title":"Burial of the Guns","description":"This is a book of short stories centered around the Civil War and its aftermath. The author was a prominent Virginian in his day, and his writing shows a talent for poignant reminiscences. The title comes from the second story, in which an artillery unit detached from Lee's army determines to follow their last orders - not to let their cannons fall into Union hands - despite Lee's surrender and the end of the War in Virginia. The other stories focus on individuals in the post-War years.<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/332\/332-h\/332-h.htm","language":"English","copyright_year":"1894","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8776","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/burial_of_guns_ms_1404_librivox\/burial_of_guns_ms_1404_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-burial-of-the-guns-by-thomas-nelson-page\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"05:52:22","totaltimesecs":21142,"authors":[{"id":"4932","first_name":" Thomas Nelson","last_name":"Page","dob":"1853","dod":"1922"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/burial_of_guns_ms_1404_librivox","sections":[{"id":"308558","section_number":"1","title":"My Cousin Fanny, Pt 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/icequeen\/burialoftheguns_01_page_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"1874","file_name":"burialoftheguns_01_page_128kb.mp3","readers":[{"reader_id":"204","display_name":"Mark F.
