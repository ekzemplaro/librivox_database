{"books":{"23":{"id":"10430","title":"Literature in the Making, by Some of its Makers","description":"This is a collection of 23 essays by some of the most famous authors of the time (1917) on a wide range of topics. They are based on interviews conducted by Joyce Kilmer. Kilmer's idea, as outlined in the Introduction, was that there is a deep divide between those who write literature, and those who write about literature. He thus bridges the gap and asks authors, the 'makers' as mentioned in the title of the work, about their opinion about various topics. - Summary by
