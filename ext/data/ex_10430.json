{"books":{"23":{"id":"10430","title":"Literature in the Making, by Some of its Makers","description":"This is a collection of 23 essays by some of the most famous authors of the time (1917) on a wide range of topics. They are based on interviews conducted by Joyce Kilmer. Kilmer's idea, as outlined in the Introduction, was that there is a deep divide between those who write literature, and those who write about literature. He thus bridges the gap and asks authors, the 'makers' as mentioned in the title of the work, about their opinion about various topics. - Summary by Carolin","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/literatureinmaki00kilmrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10430","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1341","first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"Kilmer","dob":"1886","dod":"1918"},{"id":"18","first_name":"","last_name":"Various","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"356818","section_number":"1","title":"Introduction","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356819","section_number":"2","title":"War Stops Literature","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356820","section_number":"3","title":"The Joys of the Poor","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356821","section_number":"4","title":"National Prosperity and Art","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356822","section_number":"5","title":"Romanticism and American Humor","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356823","section_number":"6","title":"The 'Movies' Benefit Literature","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10261","display_name":"Kathleen Moore"}]},{"id":"356824","section_number":"7","title":"What is Genius?","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10261","display_name":"Kathleen Moore"}]},{"id":"356825","section_number":"8","title":"Deterioration of the Short Story","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356826","section_number":"9","title":"Some Harmful Influences","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356827","section_number":"10","title":"The Passing of the Snob","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356828","section_number":"11","title":"Commericalizing the Sex Instinct","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356829","section_number":"12","title":"Sixteen Don'ts for Poets","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356830","section_number":"13","title":"Magazines Cheapen Fiction","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356831","section_number":"14","title":"Business Incompatible with Art","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356832","section_number":"15","title":"The Novel Must Go","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356833","section_number":"16","title":"Literature in the Colleges","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/literature_16_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"356834","section_number":"17","title":"City Life versus Literature","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356835","section_number":"18","title":"'Evasive Idealism' in Literature","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356836","section_number":"19","title":"'Chocolate Fudge' in the Magazines","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356837","section_number":"20","title":"The New Spirit in Poetry","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356838","section_number":"21","title":"A New Definition of Poetry","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10396","display_name":"John Burlinson"}]},{"id":"356839","section_number":"22","title":"Let Poetry be Free","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356840","section_number":"23","title":"The Heresy of Supermanism","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"356841","section_number":"24","title":"The Masque and Democracy","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"110","name":"Writing & Linguistics"}],"translators":[]}}}
