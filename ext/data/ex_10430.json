{"books":{"23":{"id":"10430","title":"Literature in the Making, by Some of its Makers","description":"This is a collection of 23 essays by some of the most famous authors of the time (1917) on a wide range of topics. They are based on interviews conducted by Joyce Kilmer. Kilmer's idea, as outlined in the Introduction, was that there is a deep divide between those who write literature, and those who write about literature. He thus bridges the gap and asks authors, the 'makers' as mentioned in the title of the work, about their opinion about various topics. - Summary by Carolin","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/literatureinmaki00kilmrich","language":"English","copyright_year":"1917","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10430","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1341","first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"Kilmer","dob":"1886","dod":"1918"},{"id":"18","first_name":"","last_name":"Various","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"356818","section_number":"1","title":"Introduction","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/literature_01_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10244","display_name":"BettyB"}]},{"id":"356819","section_number":"2","title":"William Dean Howells: War Stops Literature","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/literature_02_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8506","display_name":"Denise Nordell"}]},{"id":"356820","section_number":"3","title":"Kathleen Norris: The Joys of the Poor","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/literature_03_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3645","display_name":"MaryAnnS"}]},{"id":"356821","section_number":"4","title":"Booth Tarkington: National Prosperity and Art","listen_url":"http:\/\/uploads.librivox.org\/carolin\/literature_04_various_128kb2016_03_19_17_19_21.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10244","display_name":"BettyB"}]},{"id":"356822","section_number":"5","title":"Montague Glass: Romanticism and American Humor","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5872","display_name":"realisticspeakers"}]},{"id":"356823","section_number":"6","title":"Rex Beach: The 'Movies' Benefit Literature","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/literature_06_various_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10261","display_name":"Kathleen Moore"}]},{"id":"356824","section_number":"7","title":"Robert W.
