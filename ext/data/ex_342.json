{"books":{"28":{"id":"342","title":"Canterbury Tales","description":"<p>The Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century (two of them in prose, the rest in verse). The tales, some of which are originals and others not, are contained inside a frame tale and told by a group of pilgrims on their way from Southwark to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral.<br><br>\nThe themes of the tales vary, and include topics such as courtly love, treachery, and avarice. The genres also vary, and include romance, Breton lai, sermon, beast fable, and fabliau. The characters, introduced in the General Prologue of the book, tell tales of great cultural relevance.\nThe version read here was edited by D. Laing Purves (1838-1873) \u201cfor popular perusal\u201d and the language is mostly updated.\n(Summary by
