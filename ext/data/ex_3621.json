{"books":{"22":{"id":"3621","title":"Young Railroaders","description":"<p>While aimed at youths, this series of tales of the just-opening West makes a rollicking good story for adults, too. Three teen-age boys, trained as telegraphers, manage to get themselves in and out of a wide variety of harrowing circumstances. Using their knowledge of Morse code, the science of telegraphs, and the operation of railroads, the boys stir in native resourcefulness, quick-thinking, and when the occasion demands it, raw courage - to effect rescues, thwart thieves, and solve mysteries. If Tom Swift had lived in the nineteenth century, he could not have had more exciting escapades! (Summary by Mark F. Smith)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/25868","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"23","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3621","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/young_railroaders_ms_librivox\/young_railroaders_ms_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-young-railroaders-by-francis-lovell-coombs\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:20:36","totaltimesecs":30036,"authors":[{"id":"5358","first_name":" Francis Lovell","last_name":"Coombs","dob":"","dod":""}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/young_railroaders_ms_librivox","sections":[{"id":"190383","section_number":"1","title":"One Kind of Wireless","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1580","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"204","display_name":"Mark F.
