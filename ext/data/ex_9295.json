{"books":{"5":{"id":"9295","title":"Adventures of Old Mr. Toad","description":"The Adventures of Old Mr. Toad is another in the long line of children's books by conservationist Thornton W. Burgess. In this book, we follow the adventures of Old Mr. Toad as he joins the Spring Chorus at the Smiling Pool, shows off his babies, displays his special tongue to Peter Rabbit and has a very special encounter with Buster Bear. We also learn little lessons about life such as pride can burst like a great big bubble, your friends' hidden talents may surprise you and it is considered impolite to watch someone change his clothes - especially when he eats them.
