She observes with keen insight, the varied persons, from Indian scouts, to enlisted men, to officer\u2019s wives, who make up the army \u201cfamily,\u201d on the post. Her sympathetic story about the regimental laundress and midwife, with its sad ending, should take a place in the army\u2019s history of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d (Summary by Sue
