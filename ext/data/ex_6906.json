You will like to hear her reading better than my dull way of telling them, and I can help Minnie and Lotty with their work, for I see they are bent on learning to spin.\"<br\/><br\/>\n\nThe young folk were well pleased with grandma's proposal; for Aunt Nell was a favorite with all, being lively and kind and fond of children, and the only maiden aunt in the family. Now, she smilingly produced a faded old portfolio, and, turning over a little pile of manuscripts, said in her pleasant way:<br\/><br\/>\n\n\"Here are all sorts, picked up in my travels at home and abroad; and in order to suit all of you, I have put the names on slips of paper into this basket, and each can draw one in turn. Does that please my distinguished audience?\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>\n\n(Summary by TriciaG and from the book)<br\/><br\/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/36221","language":"English","copyright_year":"1884","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6906","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox\/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/spinning-wheel-stories-by-louisa-may-alcott\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:59:51","totaltimesecs":25191,"authors":[{"id":"93","first_name":"Louisa May","last_name":"Alcott","dob":"1832","dod":"1888"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox","sections":[{"id":"103117","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Grandma's Story","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2025","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7556","display_name":"Alex Lau"}]},{"id":"103118","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Tabby's Table-Cloth","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1911","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7789","display_name":"Lauren Jane"}]},{"id":"103119","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Eli's Education","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2242","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6914","display_name":"Katalina Watt"}]},{"id":"103120","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Onawandah","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1773","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7789","display_name":"Lauren Jane"}]},{"id":"103121","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Little Things","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2054","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6914","display_name":"Katalina Watt"}]},{"id":"103122","section_number":"6","title":"06 - The Banner of Beaumanoir","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2306","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7823","display_name":"Bart in 't Veld"}]},{"id":"103123","section_number":"7","title":"07 - Jerseys; or, the Girl's Ghost","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2404","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7416","display_name":"Jeanni Hall"}]},{"id":"103124","section_number":"8","title":"08 - The Little House in the Garden","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2389","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7387","display_name":"Tara Dow"}]},{"id":"103125","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Daisy's Jewel-Box, and How She Filled It","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1927","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7584","display_name":"kandice stehlik"}]},{"id":"103126","section_number":"10","title":"10 - Corny's Catamount","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2103","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7416","display_name":"Jeanni Hall"}]},{"id":"103127","section_number":"11","title":"11 - The Cooking-Class","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1842","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7026","display_name":"Michele Eaton"}]},{"id":"103128","section_number":"12","title":"12 - The Hare and the Tortoise","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2215","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7246","display_name":"Lyn Silva"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
