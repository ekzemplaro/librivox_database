{"books":{"31":{"id":"7256","title":"Abide in Christ","description":"Towards the close of his ministry on earth, Jesus taught his disciples of the need for them to abide in Him. This word \"abide\" speaks of the intimacy of fellowship with the Master to which his followers are still invited. Andrew Murray wrote this series of meditations, which he subtitled \"Thoughts on the Blessed Life of Fellowship with the Son of God\", out of a conviction that many believers are missing out on something that is really at the heart of a healthy Christian life. The author explains that many, although they trust the Lord for forgiveness and help, have yet to experience the blessing of a day by day and hour by hour walk with the Lord, and therefore are not enjoying the power, the joy and the fruitfulness that is available to each one. He shows how, by taking the time to live closer to Jesus, we may move into a deeper and stronger Christian experience.
