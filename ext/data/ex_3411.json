{"books":{"14":{"id":"3411","title":"Mary Cary, Frequently Martha","description":"<p>\"My name is Mary Cary. I live in the Yorkburg Female Orphan Asylum. You may think nothing happens in an Orphan Asylum. It does. The orphans are sure enough children, and real much like the kind that have Mothers and Fathers; and that\u2019s why I am going to write this story.\" So begins Mary\u2019s diary, which she fills with her various doings and misadventures at the Asylum in Virginia and her sharp observations about life and human nature. She loathes Miss Bray, the head of the Asylum, who is not above telling bald-faced lies to the Board to further her own selfish ends. She loves Miss Katherine, the Asylum\u2019s resident nurse, who has befriended Mary and serves as a gentle role model for the child. As for Martha, she is Mary\u2019s \"other self\" who speaks out\u2014and sometimes acts out\u2014in spite of Mary\u2019s better nature. When she unexpectedly discovers her family background, Mary writes a letter to her uncle that leads to some surprising results on the way to a happy ending.<br\/><br\/>\n\nThe <i>Chicago Record-Herald<\/i> of March 12, 1910 stated, \"Let\u2019s be glad for books like Mary Cary. It isn\u2019t so much what Mary Cary does, however, as what she is, bless her! that warms the cockles of the chilliest, most snugly corseted heart.\" (Summary by Jan MacGillivray)<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/15571","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/3411","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/mary_cary_frequently_martha_jm_librivox\/mary_cary_frequently_martha_jm_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/mary-cary-frequently-martha-by-kate-langley-bosher\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:51:06","totaltimesecs":13866,"authors":[{"id":"1026","first_name":"Kate Langley","last_name":"Bosher","dob":"1865","dod":"1932"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/mary_cary_frequently_martha_jm_librivox","sections":[{"id":"185784","section_number":"1","title":"01 - An Unthankful Orphan","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1123","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185785","section_number":"2","title":"02 - The Coming of Miss Katherine","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1063","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185786","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Mary, Frequently Martha","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"972","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185787","section_number":"4","title":"04 - The Stepped-on and the Steppers","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"853","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185788","section_number":"5","title":"05 - 'Here Comes the Bride!'","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"904","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185789","section_number":"6","title":"06 - 'My Lady of the Lovely Heart'","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"802","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185790","section_number":"7","title":"07 - 'Sterilized and Fertilized'","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"425","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185791","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Mary Cary's Business","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"789","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185792","section_number":"9","title":"09 - Love is Best","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"996","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185793","section_number":"10","title":"10 - The Reagan Ball","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"450","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185794","section_number":"11","title":"11 - Finding Out","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1392","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185795","section_number":"12","title":"12 - A True Miracle","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1130","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185796","section_number":"13","title":"13 - His Coming","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"624","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185797","section_number":"14","title":"14 - The Hurt of Happiness","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1148","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]},{"id":"185798","section_number":"15","title":"15 - A Real Wedding","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1195","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1752","display_name":"Jan MacGillivray"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"},{"id":"14","name":"Fictional Biographies & Memoirs"},{"id":"41","name":"General"}],"translators":[]}}}
