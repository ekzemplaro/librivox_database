{"books":{"7":{"id":"619","title":"King in Yellow (part 2)","description":"<p><br>Robert W. Chambers (1865-1933) studied art in Paris in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s. Shortly after returning to America, he became popular as the writer of a number of romantic novels; he is now best known as the author of \u201cThe King In Yellow\u201d, which is a collection of short stories with the reputation of being eerie and other-worldly. However, the last few stories in the collection, which are presented here, are essentially straightforward love stories, strongly coloured by the author\u2019s life as an artist in France.
