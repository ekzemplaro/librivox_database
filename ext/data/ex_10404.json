{"books":{"17":{"id":"10404","title":"Mystery Girl","description":"Was it murder or suicide?  All entrances to the study where the body was found were locked from the inside.  The future college president and groom-to-be had no known cause for suicide, yet no clues in either direction appeared to make any sense.  Was Anita, the Mystery Girl, who had just arrived in the New England college town, somehow been implicated?  Had she any reason to ensure of the demise of the well-liked man?  Perhaps some love letters between the two that nobody was to know about?  And what of the mark of a ring on the deceased man's forehead?  The college town was abuzz, and it seemed everyone had their own ideas of what actually happened. - Summary by Roger
