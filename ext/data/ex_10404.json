{"books":{"17":{"id":"10404","title":"Mystery Girl","description":"Was it murder or suicide?  All entrances to the study where the body was found were locked from the inside.  The future college president and groom-to-be had no known cause for suicide, yet no clues in either direction appeared to make any sense.  Was Anita, the Mystery Girl, who had just arrived in the New England college town, somehow been implicated?  Had she any reason to ensure of the demise of the well-liked man?  Perhaps some love letters between the two that nobody was to know about?  And what of the mark of a ring on the deceased man's forehead?  The college town was abuzz, and it seemed everyone had their own ideas of what actually happened. - Summary by Roger Melin","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/44984","language":"English","copyright_year":"1922","num_sections":"18","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10404","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1752","first_name":"Carolyn","last_name":"Wells","dob":"1862","dod":"1942"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"356062","section_number":"1","title":"A President-Elect","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/mysterygirl_01_wells.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356063","section_number":"2","title":"Miss Mystery Arrives","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/mysterygirl_02_wells.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356064","section_number":"3","title":"Thirteen Buttons","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/knotyouraveragejo\/mysterygirl_03_wells.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356065","section_number":"4","title":"A Broken Teacup","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356066","section_number":"5","title":"The Tragedy","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356067","section_number":"6","title":"An Incredible Case","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356068","section_number":"7","title":"The Volume of Martial","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356069","section_number":"8","title":"Where is Nogi?","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356070","section_number":"9","title":"A Love Letter","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356071","section_number":"10","title":"Who is Miss Mystery?","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356072","section_number":"11","title":"The Spinster's Evidence","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356073","section_number":"12","title":"Maurice Trask, Heir","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356074","section_number":"13","title":"The Truesdell Eyebrows","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356075","section_number":"14","title":"A Proposal","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356076","section_number":"15","title":"Fleming Stone Comes","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356077","section_number":"16","title":"Miss Mystery's Testimony","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356078","section_number":"17","title":"Planning an Elopement","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]},{"id":"356079","section_number":"18","title":"Miss Mystery No Longer","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2156","display_name":"Roger Melin"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"5","name":"Crime & Mystery Fiction"},{"id":"22","name":"Detective Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
