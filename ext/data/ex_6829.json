{"books":{"31":{"id":"6829","title":"Pollyanna (version 2)","description":"In a small town far out West, 11 year old Pollyanna loses her mother then her dad to disease.  This book describes how the orphan is sent to be raised by her aunt who lives far away in the East of the country. Unfortunately her aunt does not want her but accepts her very reluctantly only out of 'duty' and sticks her into a tiny hot attic room so she will be 'out of the way'.  What Aunt Polly does not know is that Pollyanna is bringing the game of being 'glad' that her father taught her and that her irrepressible happy attitude will transform not only that dull and miserable house, but an entire village before she is through.
