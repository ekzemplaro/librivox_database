He joins the crew of a sloop named the <i>Dazzler,<\/i> but quickly figures out his captain, Pete Le Maire (nicknamed \"French Pete\") frequently engages himself and those at his command in criminal activity. Will Joe be able to escape this unwanted and dangerous new life at sea? <br><\/br>Published in 1902, Jack London sold this book (his first full-length novel) as a boy's adventure novel set in San Francisco, his hometown.
