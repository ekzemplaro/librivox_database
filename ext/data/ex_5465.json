{"books":{"12":{"id":"5465","title":"Whose Body? (Version 2)","description":"Whose Body? is the first of Dorothy Sayers\u2019s famous Lord Peter Wimsey novels, introducing that nobleman, as well as his manservant and fellow-sleuth, Mervyn Bunter. Scotland Yard\u2019s Inspector Charles Parker, who figures more or less prominently in later Wimsey novels, plays a central role in Whose Body? as well.\n\nAs the book opens, a bashful Battersea architect has discovered a naked body in his bath, adorned with a gold pince nez. At the same time, we learn of the disappearance \u2013 under odd circumstances \u2013 of Sir Reuben Levy, a powerful financial magnate in The City. Not accepting the police\u2019s early assumption that the corpse and Sir Reuben are one and the same, Wimsey and Parker follow up the two puzzles alternately and interchangeably, coming together to compare notes. Bunter\u2019s peculiar insights and photographic evidence are also important in illuminating the mystry. Ultimately, Lord Peter and Inspector Parker are forced to conclude that the two mysteries are, in fact, pieces of a single, extremely sinister plot.\n\nWhose Body? is not as polished as Sayers\u2019s later novels. However, it is a terrific book. The writing is beautiful, filled with vivid description, dry humor, and interesting (though often arcane) allusions. The story moves quickly, and even Sayers aficionados claim they can\u2019t tell \u201cwhodunit\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d until at least half way through. This book\u2019s elegant but also extremely friendly prose prefigures Sayers\u2019s position as one of the three or four best of Britain\u2019s \u201cGolden Age\u201d mystery novelists.\n\n(Introduction by Kirsten Wever)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/digital.library.upenn.edu\/women\/sayers\/body\/whose-body.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1923","num_sections":"13","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5465","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/whose_body_1105_librivox\/whose_body_1105_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whose_Body?","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/whose-body-version-2-by-dorothy-l-sayers\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"6:46:37","totaltimesecs":24397,"authors":[{"id":"2018","first_name":"Dorothy L.","last_name":"Sayers","dob":"1893","dod":"1957"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/whose_body_1105_librivox","sections":[{"id":"65723","section_number":"0","title":"01 - Chapter 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1600","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65724","section_number":"1","title":"02 - Chapter 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2013","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65725","section_number":"2","title":"03 - Chapter 3","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1522","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65726","section_number":"3","title":"04 - Chapter 4","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2654","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65727","section_number":"4","title":"05 - Chapter 5","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2838","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65728","section_number":"5","title":"06 - Chapter 6","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"3333","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65729","section_number":"6","title":"07 - Chapter 7","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1991","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65730","section_number":"7","title":"08 - Chapter 8","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1029","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65731","section_number":"8","title":"09 - Chapter 9","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1504","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65732","section_number":"9","title":"10 -Chapter 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2196","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65733","section_number":"10","title":"11 - Chapter 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1193","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65734","section_number":"11","title":"12 - Chapter 12","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"841","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]},{"id":"65735","section_number":"12","title":"13 - Chapter 13","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2364","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5789","display_name":"Kirsten Wever"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"22","name":"Detective Fiction"}],"translators":[]}}}
