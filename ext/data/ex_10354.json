{"books":{"11":{"id":"10354","title":"Lectures on Tropical Diseases","description":"This short volume consists of the ten lectures which Sir Patrick Manson, medical adviser to the Colonial Office, delivered in San Francisco in 1905. Valuable to this day are his clinical descriptions: the three foot Guinea worm, still treated by slowly winding it on a stick when its tail emerges from the patient's leg, filarial elephantiasis, malaria, sleeping sickness, the wasting sickness kala-azar, plus sound advice on how to diagnose puzzling tropical fevers. The book is also an inadvertent chronicle of British imperialism. - Summary by Pamela Nagami, M.D.","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/lecturesontropi01mansgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1905","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10354","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11654","first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Manson","dob":"1844","dod":"1922"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"354343","section_number":"1","title":"Principles Determining the Geographical Distribution of Tropical Diseases, Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/tropicaldiseases_01_manson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354344","section_number":"2","title":"Principles Determining the Geographical Distribution of Tropical Diseases, Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/tropicaldiseases_02_manson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354345","section_number":"3","title":"Dracontiasis: Endemic H\u00e6moptysis","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/tropicaldiseases_03_manson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354346","section_number":"4","title":"Bilharziosis: Filariasis, Part 1","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/chocoholic\/tropicaldiseases_04_manson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354347","section_number":"5","title":"Bilharziosis: Filariasis, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354348","section_number":"6","title":"Malaria","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354349","section_number":"7","title":"Trypanosomiasis and Sleeping Sickness","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354350","section_number":"8","title":"Febrile Tropical Spleno-megaly (Kala-Azar)","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354351","section_number":"9","title":"The Diagnosis of Tropical Fevers","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354352","section_number":"10","title":"The Diagnosis of Tropical Fevers (continued)","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354353","section_number":"11","title":"Treatment of Fevers and Fluxes","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]},{"id":"354354","section_number":"12","title":"Problems of Tropical Medicine","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10191","display_name":"Pamela Nagami"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"94","name":"Medical"}],"translators":[]}}}
