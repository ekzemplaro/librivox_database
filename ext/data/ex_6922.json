This edition contains 878 quatrains, and represents the most extensive translation of Omar's rubai in any language.<br><br>In the Introduction, Nathan Haskell Dole writes: Mr Thompson has put into English verse this whole body of Persian poetry. It is a marvel of close translation, accurate and satisfactory. He has succeeded in doing exactly what he set out to do - to add nothing and to take nothing away, but to put into the typical quatrain, as determined by Fitzgerald and others, exactly what Omar and his unknown imitators said. (Summary by Algy Pug)<br><br>This project was proof listened by Algy Pug and Bev J. Stevens.<br><br>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/ia600307.us.archive.org\/34\/items\/quatrainsomarkh00thomgoog\/quatrainsomarkh00thomgoog.pdf","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6922","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/quatrains_khayyam_1301_librivox\/quatrains_khayyam_1301_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/quatrains-of-omar-khayyam-of-nishapur-by-omar-khayyam\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:17:02","totaltimesecs":15422,"authors":[{"id":"1299","first_name":"Omar","last_name":"Khayy\u00e1m","dob":"1048","dod":"1131"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/quatrains_khayyam_1301_librivox","sections":[{"id":"103586","section_number":"0","title":"Introduction & preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1388","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"103587","section_number":"1","title":"Quatrains 1 - 101","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1682","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6965","display_name":"NoelBadrian"}]},{"id":"103588","section_number":"2","title":"Quatrains 102 - 200\t","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1420","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6173","display_name":"Carol Box"}]},{"id":"103589","section_number":"3","title":"Quatrains 201 - 299","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1525","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]},{"id":"103590","section_number":"4","title":"Quatrains 300 - 401","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1697","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4697","display_name":"Jannie Meisberger"}]},{"id":"103591","section_number":"5","title":"Quatrains 402 - 500","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1723","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3816","display_name":"Bev J Stevens"}]},{"id":"103592","section_number":"6","title":"Quatrains 501 - 599","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1601","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3816","display_name":"Bev J Stevens"}]},{"id":"103593","section_number":"7","title":"Quatrains 600 - 701","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1701","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7138","display_name":"CaprishaPage"}]},{"id":"103594","section_number":"8","title":"Quatrains 702 - 815","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1609","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1259","display_name":"Elizabeth Klett"}]},{"id":"103595","section_number":"9","title":"Quatrains 816 - 878","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1076","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4705","display_name":"Algy Pug"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"4","name":"Classics (Antiquity)"},{"id":"25","name":"Poetry"},{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"98","name":"Philosophy"},{"id":"102","name":"Religion"}],"translators":[{"id":"7094","first_name":" Eben Francis","last_name":"Thompson","dob":"","dod":""}]}}}
