{"books":{"21":{"id":"10167","title":"Celebrated Crimes, Vol. 3: Mary Stuart","description":"The contents of these volumes of 'Celebrated Crimes', as well as the motives which led to their inception, are unique. They are a series of stories based upon historical records, from the pen of Alexandre Dumas, pere, when he was not \"the elder,\" nor yet the author of D'Artagnan or Monte Cristo, but was a rising young dramatist and a lion in the literary set and world of fashion.<br><\/br>The third volume is devoted to the story of Mary Queen of Scots, another woman who suffered a violent death, and around whose name an endless controversy has waged. Dumas goes carefully into the dubious episodes of her stormy career, but does not allow these to blind his sympathy for her fate. Mary, it should be remembered, was closely allied to France by education and marriage, and the French never forgave Elizabeth the part she played in the tragedy. - Summary by Introduction","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/2760","language":"English","copyright_year":"1910","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10167","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"431","first_name":"Alexandre","last_name":"Dumas","dob":"1802","dod":"1870"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"348328","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10255","display_name":"CaptainKinetic"}]},{"id":"348329","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter I, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10255","display_name":"CaptainKinetic"}]},{"id":"348330","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter II, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348331","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter II, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348332","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter III, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348333","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter III, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348334","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter IV","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348335","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter V, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348336","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter V, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348337","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter V, part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348338","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter V, part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348339","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter V, part 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348340","section_number":"13","title":"Chapter VI","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348341","section_number":"14","title":"Chapter VII, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348342","section_number":"15","title":"Chapter VII, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348343","section_number":"16","title":"Chapter VIII, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348344","section_number":"17","title":"Chapter VIII, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348345","section_number":"18","title":"Chapter VIII, part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348346","section_number":"19","title":"Chapter IX, part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348347","section_number":"20","title":"Chapter IX, part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348348","section_number":"21","title":"Chapter IX, part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"348349","section_number":"22","title":"Chapter X","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
