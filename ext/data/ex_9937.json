Among his exploits:\n\n- Sent warming pans to the (very, very warm) West Indies. His captain sold them as molasses ladles. Made a profit.\n- Sent wool mittens to the same place, sold them to a passing Asian trader for export to Siberia. Made a profit.\n- Literally shipped coal to Newcastle (a huge exporter of coal). Showed up during a miner's strike and sold it at a huge markup to the other traders waiting for it to end. Made a profit.\n- Shipped bibles to the East Indies. Sold them to missionaries. Made a profit.\n- Shipped cats to the Caribbean. Turns out there was a massive rat infestation at the time. Made a profit.\n- Hoarded whalebone by accident. Sold it for use in corsets. Made a profit.\n- Faked his own death, attended his own funeral, and caned his wife for not crying enough. Presumably didn't make a profit.\n- Bought an opulent mansion, with statues of George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Jefferson, William Pitt, and himself, with the inscription \"I am the first in the East, the first in the West, and the greatest philosopher in the Western World\". Lived in it for the rest of his days, which is sort of like making a profit.\n\nAnd finally, he wrote a fascinating mess of a rambling, incoherent book about himself, with inconsistent capitalization and no punctuation, then printed a second edition with a few extra pages filled with nothing but punctuation, instructing readers to \"peper and solt it as they plese.\" Made a profit. A Pickle for the Knowing Ones or Plain Truth in a Homespun Dress is that book.\n(Mogloren and Mary Kay) \n - Summary by Mogloren and Mary Kay","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/43453","language":"English","copyright_year":"1848","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9937","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"11403","first_name":"Timothy ","last_name":"Dexter","dob":"1748","dod":"1806"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"341657","section_number":"0","title":"Preface","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10132","display_name":"Tsany"}]},{"id":"341658","section_number":"1","title":"A Pickle for the Knowing Ones","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341659","section_number":"2","title":"From the Museum of Timothy Dexter, Esq.","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341660","section_number":"3","title":"This Cometh Greeting","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341661","section_number":"4","title":"For the Impartial Herald","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341662","section_number":"5","title":"Wonder of Wonders!","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341663","section_number":"6","title":"Appendix, In Honor of Timothy Dexter, Esq.","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341664","section_number":"7","title":"From the Providence Phoenix of December, 1804","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"341665","section_number":"8","title":"Advertisement Extra. of the Celebrated Lord Dexter","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]}],"genres":[{"id":"80","name":"Biography & Autobiography"}],"translators":[]}}}
