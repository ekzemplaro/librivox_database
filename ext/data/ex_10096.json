{"books":{"8":{"id":"10096","title":"Papers","description":"Today the world is awash with \u201ccelebrities\u201d whose only accomplishment is being celebrated by the media in all its various forms. Henry James, of course, long pre-dates the multiplicity of media in today\u2019s world, when the press was the main source of adulation, and he was famously averse to giving newspaper interviews himself. For those interested in the sources of celebrity worship, however, his story, \u201cThe Papers,\u201d showing how two aspiring London journalists worked with those who were famous simply for being famous, helps to give some idea of how such worship was practiced a century ago.
