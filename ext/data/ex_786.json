{"books":{"19":{"id":"786","title":"Good Soldier","description":"<p>The Good Soldier (1915) \"... is set just before World War I and chronicles the tragedies of the lives of two seemingly perfect couples. The novel is told using a series of flashbacks in non-chronological order, a literary technique pioneered by Ford.

The novel was loosely based on two incidents of adultery and on Ford's messy personal life.\u201d (Summary by Wikipedia)<\/p>\n\nMusic in sections 1-5 \"Minuet in G flat major and Valse Bluette\" by Beethoven.<br\/>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2775","language":"English","copyright_year":"1915","num_sections":"20","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/786","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/good_soldier_0912_librivox\/good_soldier_0912_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Good_Soldier","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-good-soldier-by-ford-madox-ford\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"7:39:35","totaltimesecs":27575,"authors":[{"id":"281","first_name":"Ford Madox","last_name":"Ford","dob":"1873","dod":"1939"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/good_soldier_0912_librivox","sections":[{"id":"883","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
