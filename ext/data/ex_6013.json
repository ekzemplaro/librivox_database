{"books":{"5":{"id":"6013","title":"Monsieur Beaucaire","description":"A madcap Frenchman posing as an ambassador's barber blackmails a dishonest duke to introduce him as a nobleman to a wealthy belle of Bath. Since the duke himself hopes to mend his fortunes by wedding this very woman, he attempts to murder Beaucaire, and failing that to discredit him. To test the lady's mettle, Beaucaire allows his deception to be exposed--up to a point--and there we must draw the curtain to preserve the surprise ending. ( Summary by Thomas A. Copeland )","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/1983","language":"English","copyright_year":"1900","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6013","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/monsieur_beaucaire_1111_librivox\/monsieur_beaucaire_1111_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monsieur_Beaucaire_(novel)","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/monsieur-beaucaire-by-booth-tarkington\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:29:16","totaltimesecs":5356,"authors":[{"id":"119","first_name":"Booth","last_name":"Tarkington","dob":"1869","dod":"1946"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/monsieur_beaucaire_1111_librivox","sections":[{"id":"79525","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapter 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1230","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6249","display_name":"Thomas A.
