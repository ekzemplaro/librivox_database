{"books":{"35":{"id":"10320","title":"Silas Strong","description":"The book has one high ambition. It has tried to tell the sad story of the wilderness itself\u2014to show, from the woodsman's view-point, the play of great forces which have been tearing down his home and turning it into the flesh and bone of cities.  Some of the people of these pages, when the author endeavored to regulate their conduct according to well-known rules of literary construction, declared themselves free and independent. When, urged by him, they tried to speak and act in the fashion of most novels, they laughed, and seemed to be ashamed of themselves, and with good reason.\nThey are slow, stubborn, modest, shy, and used to the open. Not for them are the narrow stage, the swift action, the fine-wrought chain of artful incident that characterize a modern romance.  Addison Irving Bacheller (September 26, 1859 \u2013 February 24, 1950) was an American journalist and writer who founded the first modern newspaper syndicate in the United States.  He was a graduate of St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York in 1882.  It was through the Bacheller Syndicate that he brought to American readers the writings of British authors such as Joseph Conrad, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Rudyard Kipling. He also established a working partnership with the young author and journalist Stephen Crane, whose novel The Red Badge of Courage became famous after it appeared in syndication.  St. Lawrence's Gunninson Memorial Chapel bells are named \"The Bacheller Memorial Chimes\" in his honor. Additionally, the St Lawrence English department's honorary society is named for him, and one of the dining halls bears the name \"Eben Holden\". - Summary by Author preface,
