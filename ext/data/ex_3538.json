{"books":{"16":{"id":"3538","title":"In the Bishop's Carriage","description":"<br \/>Nancy 'Nance' Olden, a young and very pretty woman, is an accomplished liar and thief. Raised in a horrific orphanage, called the Cruelty by its occupants, Nance and her criminal boyfriend, Tom Dorgan, are pulling a con when the book begins. The results of their act propel Nance into a series of events that she could never have imagined. This was Miriam Michelson's first novel and it was considered a 'blockbuster' in its day. Ranked fourth on the list of bestsellers of 1904 by \"Publishers Weekly,\" Michelson's book was a source of controversy due to the dubious ethics and morals of its heroine.
