{"books":{"19":{"id":"6213","title":"Confucian Analects","description":"The Analects, or Lunyu (simplified Chinese: \u8bba\u8bed; traditional Chinese: \u8ad6\u8a9e; pinyin: L\u00fan Y\u01d4; literally \"Classified\/Ordered Sayings\"), also known as the Analects of Confucius, are considered a record of the words and acts of the central Chinese thinker and philosopher Confucius and his disciples, as well as the discussions they held. Written during the Spring and Autumn Period through the Warring States Period (ca. 475 BC - 221 BC), the Analects is the representative work of Confucianism and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. <br \/><br \/>James Legge (Chinese: \u7406\u96c5\u5404; December 20, 1815 \u2013 November 29, 1897) was a noted Scottish sinologist, a Scottish Congregationalist, representative of the London Missionary Society in Malacca and Hong Kong (1840\u20131873), and first professor of Chinese at Oxford University (1876\u20131897). In association with Max M\u00fcller he prepared the monumental Sacred Books of the East series, published in 50 volumes between 1879 and 1891.
