{"books":{"5":{"id":"9596","title":"Adventures of Bob White","description":"The Adventures of Bob White is another in the long line of children's books by conservationist Thornton W. Burgess.  In this book, Bob White and Mrs. Bob White make a new home near the Old Briar Patch where they become neighbors with Peter Rabbit.  We learn what Bob White likes to eat, how he protects his nest from being discovered, and who his friends and his enemies are.  We also learn that sometimes it's not good to know everything, that arithmetic can be a useful tool, and that a Bob White needs to stay far away from the two-legged creatures who carry fire-sticks. - Summary by John Lieder","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/46950","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"6","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/9596","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"282","first_name":"Thornton W.","last_name":"Burgess","dob":"1874","dod":"1965"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"330658","section_number":"1","title":"01 - Chapters 01-04","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1121","display_name":"John Lieder"}]},{"id":"330659","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Chapters 05-08","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1121","display_name":"John Lieder"}]},{"id":"330660","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Chapters 09-11","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1121","display_name":"John Lieder"}]},{"id":"330661","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Chapters 12-15","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1121","display_name":"John Lieder"}]},{"id":"330662","section_number":"5","title":"05 - Chapters 16-19","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1121","display_name":"John Lieder"}]},{"id":"330663","section_number":"6","title":"06 - Chapters 20-22","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"1121","display_name":"John Lieder"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"38","name":"Animals & Nature"}],"translators":[]}}}
