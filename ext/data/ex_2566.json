{"books":{"3":{"id":"2566","title":"Biography of a Grizzly","description":"I first read this little book when I was in the fifth grade, and now more than fifty years later, I still find it fascinating. Ernest Thompson Seton was a man with a concern for nature her creatures and an excellent story teller. I could almost feel Wahb, the great grizzly\u2019s pain and frustration as he tried to avoid contact with humans and just be left alone to carry out his bear business. Listening to this audio book will be an hour and a half well spent. Summary by Mike Vendetti, Narrator.","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/25023","language":"English","copyright_year":"1899","num_sections":"4","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/2566","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/biography_grizzly_mv_0810_librivox\/biography_grizzly_mv_0810_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-biography-of-a-grizzly\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:31:53","totaltimesecs":5513,"authors":[{"id":"634","first_name":"Ernest Thompson","last_name":"Seton","dob":"1860","dod":"1946"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/biography_grizzly_mv_0810_librivox","sections":[{"id":"167712","section_number":"0","title":"00 - Dedication, Preface","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"145","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3020","display_name":"Mike Vendetti"}]},{"id":"167713","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The Cubhood of Wahb","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2000","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3020","display_name":"Mike Vendetti"}]},{"id":"167714","section_number":"2","title":"02 - The Days of His Strength","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1660","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3020","display_name":"Mike Vendetti"}]},{"id":"167715","section_number":"3","title":"03 - The Waning","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1708","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"3020","display_name":"Mike Vendetti"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"38","name":"Animals & Nature"}],"translators":[]}}}
