{"books":{"6":{"id":"7074","title":"Men of Harlech","description":"LibriVox readers present 7 versions of \"Men of Harlech\" by Talhaiarn. This was the weekly poem for the week of September 23, 2012.<br\/><br\/>\n\n\"Men of Harlech\" or \"The March of the Men of Harlech\" is a song and military march which is traditionally said to describe events during the seven year long siege of Harlech Castle between 1461 and 1468. The music was first published without words in 1794, but it is said to be a much earlier folk air. The song was published in Volume II of the 1862 collection Welsh Melodies with the Welsh lyrics by the Welsh poet John Jones (Talhaiarn). A version translated by John Oxenford was published in \"The Songs of Wales\" in 1873 with music edited by Brinley Richards. This is the version recorded in this week's poetry project.
