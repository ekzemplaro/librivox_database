{"books":{"11":{"id":"496","title":"History of England, from the Accession of James II - (Volume 1, Chapter 04)","description":"<p>This chapter is a bit of a mixture. It begins with the death of Charles II and then goes on to James II. Judge Jeffries then makes an appearance in a riot of slapstick absurdity when viewed from so far away. Although, at the time of the \u2018Bloody Assizes\u2019 he will have been much feared and hated by many.There are more to-and fro-ings in the Houses of Parliament. The Scots Covenanters make an appearance and dangerfield and Oates get their come-uppance. Macaulay paints the mid to late 17th century in a mad effervescence of colour.\n<br>Summary by Jim Mowatt<\/p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/1468","language":"English","copyright_year":"1848","num_sections":"12","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/496","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/hist01ch04\/hist01ch04_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/hist01ch04\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:11:23","totaltimesecs":11483,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/hist01ch04","sections":[{"id":"128024","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter IV, Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1680","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"128025","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter IV, Part 2","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1379","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"348","display_name":"ianish"}]},{"id":"128026","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter IV, Part 3","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"706","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"128027","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV, Part 4","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1009","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"348","display_name":"ianish"}]},{"id":"128028","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter IV, Part 5","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"892","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"348","display_name":"ianish"}]},{"id":"128029","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter IV, Part 6","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"589","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]},{"id":"128030","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter IV, Part 7","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"791","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"348","display_name":"ianish"}]},{"id":"128031","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter IV, Part 8","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1190","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"348","display_name":"ianish"}]},{"id":"128032","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter IV, Part 9","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"501","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"20","display_name":"Gesine"}]},{"id":"128033","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter IV, Part 10","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"495","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"742","display_name":"Peter Groom"}]},{"id":"128034","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter IV, Part 11","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1081","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"742","display_name":"Peter Groom"}]},{"id":"128035","section_number":"12","title":"Chapter IV, Part 12","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"1170","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"75","display_name":"Jim Mowatt"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
