{"books":{"5":{"id":"304","title":"On Liberty","description":"Published in 1859, On Liberty details Mill's view that individuals should be left wholly free to engage in any activity, thought or belief that does not harm others. Simple though it sounds, it is a position that challenges our ideas on the very nature of government and society, and sheds light on some of the key issues we face today.  A key text of political philosophy, On Liberty has been continuously in print since its first publication.
