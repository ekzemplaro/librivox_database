{"books":{"14":{"id":"10122","title":"Kashmiri Song","description":"Adela Florence Nicolson (n\u00e9e Cory) was an English poet who wrote under the pseudonym Laurence Hope. Her father was employed in the British army at Lahore and she left for India in 1881 to join her father.<\/p>\nIn 1901, she published Garden of Kama, which was published a year later in America under the title India's Love Lyrics. She attempted to pass these off as translations of various poets, but this claim soon fell under suspicion. Her poems often used imagery and symbols from the poets of the North-West Frontier of India and the Sufi poets of Persia. She was among the most popular romantic poets of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Her poems are typically about unrequited love and loss and often, the death that followed such an unhappy state of affairs. Many of them have an air of autobiography or confession. - Summary by Wikipedia<\/p>","url_text_source":"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/8197","language":"English","copyright_year":"1902","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10122","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/\/kashmiri_song_1508.poem_librivox\/kashmiri_song_1508.poem_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kashmiri_Song","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/kashmiri-song-by-laurence-hope\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"00:17:45","totaltimesecs":1065,"authors":[{"id":"10161","first_name":"Laurence","last_name":"Hope","dob":"1865","dod":"1904"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/kashmiri_song_1508.poem_librivox","sections":[{"id":"347147","section_number":"1","title":"Kashmiri Song -
