This was the fortnightly poem for the period beginning September 16, 2012.<br><br>The Lie is a political and social criticism poem probably written by Sir Walter Raleigh. Speaking in the imperative mood throughout, he commands his soul to go \"upon a thankless errand\" and tell various people and organizations of their misdeeds and wrongdoings. And if they object, Raleigh commands, publicly accuse them to be lying, or \"give them the lie.\" To \"give the lie\" was a common phrase in Raleigh's time of writing.
