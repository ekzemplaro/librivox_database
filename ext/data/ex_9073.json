During his 1902 tour through the north, west and south of Ireland the author provides entertaining insights into how those parts of Ireland were in that era. Born in Ramelton, County Donegal and education at Queens University Belfast, the Author then moved to America at the age 25. He enjoyed considerable success in Banking which lead to him  eventually becoming a billionaire. From his writing we can deduce that he used some of his wealth on international travel, one such location being back to the country of his birth.
