And why she seemed in such a rush? Well here is your chance to peek into her thoughts and enjoy some of her daily triumphs and disasters. \"Little Mrs. Ladybug was a worker. Nobody could deny that. To be sure, she had to stop now and then to talk to her neighbors, because Mrs. Ladybug dearly loved a bit of gossip. At the same time there wasn't anyone in Pleasant Valley that helped Farmer Green more than she did. She tried her hardest to keep the trees in the orchard free from insects. Some of her less worthy neighbors were known sometimes to say with a sniff, \"If Mrs. Ladybug didn't enjoy her work she wouldn't care about helping Farmer Green. If she hadn't such a big appetite she'd stop to chat even more than she does now.\" (Summary by the book and phil chenevert)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/20097","language":"English","copyright_year":"1921","num_sections":"24","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/7428","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/mrs.ladybug_1303_librivox\/mrs.ladybug_1303_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-tale-of-mrs-ladybug-by-arthur-scott-bailey\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"1:38:37","totaltimesecs":5917,"authors":[{"id":"464","first_name":"Arthur Scott","last_name":"Bailey","dob":"1877","dod":"1949"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/mrs.ladybug_1303_librivox","sections":[{"id":"114277","section_number":"1","title":"01 - The Polka Dot Lady","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"251","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6788","display_name":"Pamela Krantz"}]},{"id":"114278","section_number":"2","title":"02 - Buster's Resolve","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"324","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7925","display_name":"Etel Buss"}]},{"id":"114279","section_number":"3","title":"03 - Hidden Wings","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"301","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7925","display_name":"Etel Buss"}]},{"id":"114280","section_number":"4","title":"04 - Rusty Wren Helps","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"223","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]},{"id":"114281","section_number":"5","title":"05 - A Hard Shell","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"260","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]},{"id":"114282","section_number":"6","title":"06 - The Traveler","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"219","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8072","display_name":"Kimberly Krause"}]},{"id":"114283","section_number":"7","title":"07 - A Handsome Stranger","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"290","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7925","display_name":"Etel Buss"}]},{"id":"114284","section_number":"8","title":"08 - Seeking the Truth","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"262","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7925","display_name":"Etel Buss"}]},{"id":"114285","section_number":"9","title":"09 - That Carpetbag","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"236","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"114286","section_number":"10","title":"10 - A Bit of News","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"204","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"114287","section_number":"11","title":"11 -  \tThe New Cousin","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"231","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7733","display_name":"Jewel Raquel"}]},{"id":"114288","section_number":"12","title":"12 - A Queer Way to Help","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"207","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7733","display_name":"Jewel Raquel"}]},{"id":"114289","section_number":"13","title":"13 - Jennie Junebug","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"270","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6788","display_name":"Pamela Krantz"}]},{"id":"114290","section_number":"14","title":"14 - Bumps","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"289","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7850","display_name":"Jill Engle"}]},{"id":"114291","section_number":"15","title":"15 - Enough!","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"281","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7850","display_name":"Jill Engle"}]},{"id":"114292","section_number":"16","title":"16 - Playing Dead","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"245","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6788","display_name":"Pamela Krantz"}]},{"id":"114293","section_number":"17","title":"17 - A Brave Gentleman","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"224","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7756","display_name":"Lynne Thompson"}]},{"id":"114294","section_number":"18","title":"18 - A Mystery","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"182","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"114295","section_number":"19","title":"19 - The Dinner Bell","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"200","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8011","display_name":"Greg Giordano"}]},{"id":"114296","section_number":"20","title":"20 - Fire!
