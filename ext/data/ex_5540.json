{"books":{"10":{"id":"5540","title":"History of England, from the Accession of James II - (Volume 4, Chapter 17)","description":"This is volume 4 chapter 17 of a series of books written by the Baron Macaulay (1800-1859) in the 19th century. It starts with a brief resume of the history of England up until the Stuart kings and then starts to delve into a little more detail. Macaulay is primarily fascinated by ending of any claim to divine right of kings and the growing role of Parliament in the governing of the country. He sees the accession of William and Mary (Dutch, Protestant royalty) to the British throne as a key moment in the history of the British Isles. This is a book delightful for the literary gifts of the author and intriguing for his view of 18th century English and world politics.\n(Jim Mowatt)\n\n","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/etext\/2613","language":"English","copyright_year":"1870","num_sections":"11","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5540","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/macaulay_vol4_chap17_1109_librivox\/macaulay_vol4_chap17_1109_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thomas_Babbington_Macaulay","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-history-of-england-from-the-accession-of-james-iivol-4-ch-17-by-thomas-babington-macaulay\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"3:24:39","totaltimesecs":12279,"authors":[{"id":"802","first_name":"Thomas Babington","last_name":"Macaulay","dob":"1800","dod":"1859"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/macaulay_vol4_chap17_1109_librivox","sections":[{"id":"67881","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 01","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1240","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6395","display_name":"Richard Carpenter"}]},{"id":"67882","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 02","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1173","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6352","display_name":"stmacduff"}]},{"id":"67883","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 03","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1121","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6352","display_name":"stmacduff"}]},{"id":"67884","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 04","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1163","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6352","display_name":"stmacduff"}]},{"id":"67885","section_number":"5","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 05","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1197","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"2544","display_name":"Annise"}]},{"id":"67886","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 06","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1265","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6512","display_name":"mcgovern1934"}]},{"id":"67887","section_number":"7","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 07","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1127","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6436","display_name":"Steve Mattingly"}]},{"id":"67888","section_number":"8","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 08","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1120","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6436","display_name":"Steve Mattingly"}]},{"id":"67889","section_number":"9","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 09","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1011","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"67890","section_number":"10","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 10","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"963","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]},{"id":"67891","section_number":"11","title":"Chapter XVII, Part 11","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"899","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5860","display_name":"J L Raimundo"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
