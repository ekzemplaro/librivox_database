{"books":{"4":{"id":"10593","title":"4 Stories by Louisia May Alcott","description":"Here are four delightful short stories written by the famous author specifically for girls. As she says in the tiny preface \"These stories were written for my own amusement during a period of enforced seclusion. The flowers which were my solace and pleasure suggested titles for the tales and gave an interest to the work.   If my girls find a little beauty or sunshine in these common blossoms, their old friend will not have made her Garland in vain.\nL.M. ALCOTT.\"   The stories are An Ivy Spray & Ladies Slippers; Pansies; Water-Lillies and Mountain-Laurel & Maiden-Hair.  They are all between 40 minutes and 55 minutes finished audio so they are not short but all four are typical stories from the talented pen of Miss Alcott.   - Summary by Phil chenevert and the author","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/5830","language":"English","copyright_year":"1887","num_sections":"5","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10593","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"93","first_name":"Louisa May","last_name":"Alcott","dob":"1832","dod":"1888"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"361349","section_number":"1","title":"AN IVY SPRAY AND LADIES' SLIPPERS","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/4storiesbylouisiamayalcott_01_alcott_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9881","display_name":"Roohi"}]},{"id":"361350","section_number":"2","title":"PANSIES","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/4storiesbylouisiamayalcott_02_alcott_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10665","display_name":"Christine Lehman"}]},{"id":"361351","section_number":"3","title":"WATER-LILIES","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_03_alcott_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10261","display_name":"Kathleen Moore"}]},{"id":"361352","section_number":"4","title":"MOUNTAIN-LAUREL AND MAIDEN-HAIR - Part 1","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"10633","display_name":"Octavia Rosko"}]},{"id":"361778","section_number":"5","title":"MOUNTAIN-LAUREL AND MAIDEN-HAIR - Part 2","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/philchenevert\/4storiesbylouisiamayalcott_05_alcott_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9737","display_name":"Diana Schmidt"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"76","name":"Single Author Collections"}],"translators":[]}}}
