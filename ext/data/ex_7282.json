{"books":{"18":{"id":"7282","title":"Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes","description":"A classic of travel writing, this book recounts Stevenson's adventures on an extended walk through uplands and mountains in south-western France. Humorous on his own failings as a traveller, and on his travails with Modestine the self-willed donkey, it is also an exploration of peasant life in an area marked by the violence of the wars of religion. This version includes the fragment \"A mountain town in France\", originally intended as the opening chapter, but often omitted and published as a separate essay.
