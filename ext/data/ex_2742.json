{"books":{"48":{"id":"2742","title":"Two Years Before the Mast","description":"While there are many books upon the subject of sea life, there are few that can compare with <i>Two Years Before the Mast<\/i>. It is the story of a sailor's life from the forecastle, not a captain, nor a passenger, but a regular hand. The book was a great favorite with the jack tar of Dana's day, and two thousand copies are said to have been sold to Liverpool sailors in a single day. Even those who haven't the faintest idea what reefing topsail is, or which is starboard and which larboard, will find it an engaging story of an era long past told in simple narrative style.
