This was the Weekly Poetry project for April 24, 2011.<br><br>Henry Austin Dobson , commonly Austin Dobson, was an English poet and essayist. His official career was uneventful, but as a poet and biographer he was distinguished. Those who study his work are struck by its maturity. It was about 1864 that he turned his attention to writing original prose and verse, and some of his earliest work was his best. It was not until 1868 that the appearance of St Paul's, a magazine edited by Anthony Trollope, gave Harry Dobson an opportunity and an audience; and during the next six years he contributed some of his favourite poems, including \"Tu Quoque,\" \"A Gentleman of the Old School,\" \"A Dialogue from Plato,\" and \"Une Marquise.\" Many of his poems in their original form were illustrated\u2014some, indeed, were written to support illustrations.
