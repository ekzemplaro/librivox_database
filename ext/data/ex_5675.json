{"books":{"25":{"id":"5675","title":"Spinner in the Sun","description":"Myrtle Reed may always be depended upon to write a story in which poetry, charm, tenderness and humor are combined into a clever and entertaining book. Her characters are delightful and she always displays a quaint humor of expression and a quiet feeling of pathos which give a touch of active realism to all her writings.\nIn \"A Spinner in the Sun\" she tells an old-fashioned love story, of a veiled lady who lives in solitude and whose features her neighbors have never seen. There is a mystery at the heart of the book that throws over it the glamour of romance (Summary by Grosset & Dunlap publishers, 1913)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.online-literature.com\/myrtle-reed\/spinner-in-the-sun\/","language":"English","copyright_year":"1906","num_sections":"26","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/5675","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/spinner_sun_1110_librivox\/spinner_sun_1110_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/a-spinner-in-the-sun-by-myrtle-reed\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"8:02:14","totaltimesecs":28934,"authors":[{"id":"2406","first_name":"Myrtle","last_name":"Reed","dob":"1874","dod":"1911"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/spinner_sun_1110_librivox","sections":[{"id":"70916","section_number":"1","title":"01 -
