{"books":{"10":{"id":"2504","title":"Soup of Alphabets, Volume 002","description":"<p>A second helping of Alphabet Books! This collection has a wide-ranging variety of short books, and not only for younger readers, but also for young and not so young adults. Opening with a book based on the colorful language of London's street vendors, this collection winds its way through a book of tongue-twisters, two primers of nonsense poetry by the inimitable Edward Lear, and early readers from 19th century England. For older readers, there is the biting, sardonic humor of Hilaire Belloc's satirical alphabet verses. There is even a \"Baseball ABC,\" a recording which will be released in time for the World Series playoffs! Soup's on!
