{"books":{"8":{"id":"6382","title":"Boy Scout And Other Stories For Boys","description":"RICHARD HARDING DAVIS, as a friend and fellow author has written of him, was \u201cyouth incarnate,\u201d and there is probably nothing that he wrote of which a boy would not some day come to feel the appeal. But there are certain of his stories that go with especial directness to a boy\u2019s heart and sympathies and make for him quite unforgettable literature. A few of these were made some years ago into a volume, \u201cStories for Boys,\u201d and found a large and enthusiastic special public in addition to Davis\u2019s general readers; and the present collection from stories more recently published is issued with the same motive. This book takes its title from \u201cThe Boy Scout,\u201d the first of its tales; and it includes \u201cThe Boy Who Cried Wolf,\u201d \u201cBlood Will Tell,\u201d the immortal \u201cGallegher,\u201d and \u201cThe Bar Sinister,\u201d Davis\u2019s famous dog story. It is a fresh volume added to what Augustus Thomas calls \u201csafe stuff to give to a young fellow who likes to take off his hat and dilate his nostrils and feel the wind in his face.\u201d (Summary by Publisher's Note in book)<p>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30953","language":"English","copyright_year":"1891","num_sections":"9","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/6382","url_zip_file":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/download\/boy_scout_dw_librivox\/boy_scout_dw_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip","url_project":"","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/the-boy-scout-and-other-stories-for-boys-by-richard-harding-davis\/","url_other":null,"totaltime":"4:57:06","totaltimesecs":17826,"authors":[{"id":"812","first_name":"Richard Harding","last_name":"Davis","dob":"1864","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/boy_scout_dw_librivox","sections":[{"id":"89499","section_number":"0","title":"Publisher's Note","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"116","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89500","section_number":"1","title":"The Boy Scout","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2348","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89501","section_number":"2","title":"The Boy Who Cried Wolf","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2453","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89502","section_number":"3","title":"Gallegher, A Newspaper Story, Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2116","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89503","section_number":"4","title":"Gallegher, A Newspaper Story, Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2324","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89504","section_number":"5","title":"Blood Will Tell, Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1695","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89505","section_number":"6","title":"Blood Will Tell, Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"1606","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89506","section_number":"7","title":"The Bar Sinister, Part 1","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2868","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]},{"id":"89507","section_number":"8","title":"The Bar Sinister, Part 2","listen_url":"","language":"English","playtime":"2300","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6454","display_name":"David Wales"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"1","name":"Children's Fiction"},{"id":"37","name":"Action & Adventure"},{"id":"46","name":"Short works"}],"translators":[]}}}
