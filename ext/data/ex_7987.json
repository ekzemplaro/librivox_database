{"books":{"6":{"id":"7987","title":"Life of Anthony","description":"Anthony (251-356CE) lived in Egypt, and became one of the fathers of Christian desert monasticism. When he was about 18 years old, and having inherited a large fortune, he heard a sermon about Jesus challenging the rich young ruler to \"go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven; and come, follow Me.\" (Matt 19:21) Antony immediately sold all he had, and went out into the desert to life a life of poverty, chastity and obedience. For the rest of his life, he fought demons, performed miracles, becoming a legend in his own long lifetime.
