Thompson, considered a classic and elegant introduction to the subject. (from Wikipedia)<p>\n \n<i>Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics\u2014and they are mostly clever fools\u2014seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.\nBeing myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.<\/i> (from the Prologue)","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/33283","language":"English","copyright_year":"1914","num_sections":"58","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/10205","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Calculus_Made_Easy","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"7113","first_name":"Silvanus P.","last_name":"Thompson","dob":"1851","dod":"1916"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"349342","section_number":"0","title":"Preface to the Second Edition, Prologue","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/calculusmadeeasy_00_thompson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7326","display_name":"Adam"}]},{"id":"349343","section_number":"1","title":"Chapter I: To Deliver You from the Preliminary Terrors","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/calculusmadeeasy_01_thompson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7326","display_name":"Adam"}]},{"id":"349344","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II: On Different Degrees of Smallness","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/calculusmadeeasy_02_thompson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"349345","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III: On Relative Growings","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/calculusmadeeasy_03_thompson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8956","display_name":"katetastrophe"}]},{"id":"349346","section_number":"4","title":"Chapter IV: Simplest Cases","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/availle\/calculusmadeeasy_04_thompson_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8956","display_name":"katetastrophe"}]},{"id":"349353","section_number":"5","title":"Exercises I, Answers to Exercises I","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7326","display_name":"Adam"}]},{"id":"349347","section_number":"6","title":"Chapter V: Next Stage.
