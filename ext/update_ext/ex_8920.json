He evidently had never heard of the rue Falgui\u00e8re.<br\/>\n\"Yes, rue Falgui\u00e8re, the old rue des Fourneaux,\" I continued.<br\/>\nCabby's face broke out into a smile. \"Ah, oui, oui, le Quartier Latin.\"<br\/>\n\nAnd it was at the end of this crooked street, through a lane that led\ninto a half court flanked by a row of studio buildings, and up one pair\nof dingy waxed steps, that I found a door bearing the name of the author\nof the following pages--his visiting card impaled on a tack. He was in\nhis shirt-sleeves--the thermometer stood at 90\u00b0 outside--working at his\ndesk, surrounded by half-finished sketches and manuscript.<br\/>\n\nThe man himself I had met before--I had known him for years, in\nfact--but the surroundings were new to me. So too were his methods of\nwork.<br\/>\n\nNowadays when a man would write of the Siege of Peking or the relief of\nsome South African town with the unpronounceable name, his habit is to\nrent a room on an up-town avenue, move in an inkstand and pad, and a\ncollection of illustrated papers and encyclopedias. This writer on the\nrue Falgui\u00e8re chose a different plan. He would come back year after\nyear, and study his subject and compile his impressions of the Quarter\nin the very atmosphere of the place itself; within a stone's throw of\nthe Luxembourg Gardens and the Panth\u00e9on; near the caf\u00e9s and the Bullier;\nnext door, if you please, to the public laundry where his washerwoman\npays a few sous for the privilege of pounding his clothes into holes.<br\/>\n\nIt all seemed very real to me, as I sat beside him and watched him at\nwork. The method delighted me. I have similar ideas myself about the\nvalue of his kind of study in out-door sketching, compared with the\nlabored work of the studio, and I have most positive opinions regarding\nthe quality which comes of it.<br\/>\n\nIf then the pages which here follow have in them any of the true\ninwardness of the life they are meant to portray, it is due, I feel\nsure, as much to the attitude of the author toward his subject, as much\nto his ability to seize, retain, and express these instantaneous\nimpressions, these flash pictures caught on the spot, as to any other\nmerit which they may possess.<br\/>\n\nNothing can be made really _real_ without it.<br\/>\n\n                                              F. HOPKINSON SMITH.<br\/>\n\nParis, August, 1901.<br\/>\n(from Introduction) - Summary by F.
