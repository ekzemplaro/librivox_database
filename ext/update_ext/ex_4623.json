Mourt\u2019s Relation records in detail the Pilgrim\u2019s life in Massachusetts including the settling of Plymouth Colony, their interactions with the native Indians, and the First Thanksgiving (Mourt\u2019s Relation contains one of only two primary accounts of this event). The journal was brought back to England and in the following year was published in London presumably by George Morton, sometimes called George Mourt (hence the title \"Mourt's Relation\").\r\n(Introduction from Hannah Harris)<\/P>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/details\/mourtsrelationo00bradgoog","language":"English","copyright_year":"1865","num_sections":"8","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/4623","url_zip_file":null,"url_project":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mourt%27s_Relation","url_librivox":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=27513","url_other":null,"totaltime":null,"totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"1082","first_name":"William","last_name":"Bradford","dob":"1590","dod":"1657"},{"id":"5582","first_name":" Edward","last_name":"Winslow","dob":"1595","dod":"1655"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"211201","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]},{"id":"211202","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]},{"id":"211203","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]},{"id":"211204","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]},{"id":"211205","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]},{"id":"211206","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]},{"id":"211207","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]},{"id":"211208","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4060","display_name":"Hannah Harris"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"36","name":"*Non-fiction"},{"id":"87","name":"History "}],"translators":[]}}}
