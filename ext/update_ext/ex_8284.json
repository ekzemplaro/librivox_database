{"books":{"21":{"id":"8284","title":"Upper Room: Being a Few Truths for the Times","description":"Ryle became the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool during a volatile time for the Church of England. Some church leaders fought for high church practices and a return to Catholic tradition, and others fought for low church practices and evangelism. The Upper Room contains a miscellaneous selection of papers and sermons the author had shared with others throughout his nearly fifty-year ministry. Just as a great portion of Ryle\u2019s work focuses on Christ\u2019s life, so also did his pastoral messages stress evangelism. His commentaries reflect his deep desire for all people to hear Christ\u2019s call and receive salvation. - Summary by Kathleen O\u2019Bannon, CCEL Staff\n\n<b> Description needs to be replaced with one written by reader<\/b>","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.ccel.org\/ccel\/ryle\/upper_room.html","language":"English","copyright_year":"1887","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8284","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"2565","first_name":"J.
