{"books":{"9":{"id":"8787","title":"History of Reynard the Fox","description":"Reynard the Fox was medieval Europe's trickster figure, a nasty but charistmatic character who was always in trouble but always able to talk his way out of any retribution. The Reynard stories were (and are) available in several languages and with many variations. The digital text published here is a version translated to English by William Caxton in the late 15th century. Caxton printed his translation himself on his own printing press, one of the first in England. In editing this edition in 1889, Morley modernized the spelling of words still in common use in his day, but did not attempt to modernize the style of the text. The result is a readable text that has all the flavor of the original. - Summary by http:\/\/bestiary.ca\/etexts\/morley1889\/morley1889.htm","url_text_source":"http:\/\/catalog.hathitrust.org\/Record\/001907091","language":"English","copyright_year":"1889","num_sections":"10","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8787","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"10498","first_name":"Henry","last_name":"Morley","dob":"1822","dod":"1894"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"308844","section_number":"0","title":"","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308845","section_number":"1","title":"Introduction and Chapter I","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308846","section_number":"2","title":"Chapter II","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308847","section_number":"3","title":"Chapter III","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308848","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308849","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308850","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308851","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308852","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]},{"id":"308853","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6574","display_name":"Caden Vaughn Clegg"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"39","name":"Myths, Legends & Fairy Tales"}],"translators":[]}}}
