{"books":{"22":{"id":"9029","title":"Surprising Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew, King of the Beggars","description":"The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew was first published in 1745. Although it states that the contents were \"noted by himself during his passage to America\" and it is likely facts were supplied by Carew, the author was probably Robert Goadby, a printer in Sherborne, Dorset, who published an early edition in 1749. It has been suggested that Carew dictated his memoirs to Mrs. Goadby. The Life and Adventures continued to be a best seller throughout the next hundred years in numerous editions as books and chapbooks. He became a nationally known character, appealing to a provincial audience.  - Summary by
