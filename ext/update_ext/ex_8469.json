{"books":{"21":{"id":"8469","title":"Grotesques and Fantasies","description":"A set of often funny, sometimes tragic stories by Israel Zangwill. Most famous for his scathingly accurate portrayals of the Jewish ghetto, these stories have a wider stage, poking fun at social conventions and society itself, both high and low. The real and the fantastic collide to produce a world uniquely Zangwill's.\n\nThese are the tales of figures as diverse as a pantomime dragon, an excellent butler, a man living his life in the wrong order and a Jewish maiden who knows exactly what she is worth. Well observed and original, the satire is biting and the wit sparkling.\n\nMany of the stories in this volume are accompanied by excellent illustrations, which are well worth a look. They are available in the [url=http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/38413]Gutenberg e-text[\/url].\n\nThe novella, King of Schnorrers, which began this collection when it appeared in print, already has a separate recording [url=https:\/\/librivox.org\/the-king-of-schnorrers-by-israel-zangwill\/]here[\/url]. As such it is omitted from this collection, and only the shorter stories are included. - Summary by Summary by Lucy Perry","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/38413","language":"English","copyright_year":"1909","num_sections":"22","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8469","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"905","first_name":"Israel","last_name":"Zangwill","dob":"1864","dod":"1926"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"300777","section_number":"0","title":"Foreword","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/grotesquesandfantasies_00_zangwill_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"300778","section_number":"1","title":"The Semi-Sentimental Dragon","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/grotesquesandfantasies_01_zangwill_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7800","display_name":"Arie"}]},{"id":"300779","section_number":"2","title":"An Honest Log-Roller","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/grotesquesandfantasies_02_zangwill_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"300780","section_number":"3","title":"A Tragi-Comedy of Creeds","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/grotesquesandfantasies_03_zangwill_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6670","display_name":"Mike Pelton"}]},{"id":"300781","section_number":"4","title":"The Memory Clearing House","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/carolin\/grotesquesandfantasies_04_zangwill_128kb.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9017","display_name":"John Van Stan"}]},{"id":"300782","section_number":"5","title":"Mated by a Waiter.
