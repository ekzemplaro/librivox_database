Electra is a young woman of unknown parentage who is raised in a convent in France and, after the death of her mother Eleuteria, adopted by her aunt and uncle. Electra soon falls in love with the scientist Maximo, but an intricate web of rumors and lies threatens to ruin their relationship.  In this play, Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s tackles a number of hot-button themes: fanaticism, superstition, social justice, rationalism, and the powers of science. - Summary by ChuckW","url_text_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/contemporaryspan00turruoft","language":"English","copyright_year":"1919","num_sections":"21","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8766","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"http:\/\/es.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electra_(Gald\u00f3s)","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"5244","first_name":" Benito","last_name":"P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s","dob":"1843","dod":"1920"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"308146","section_number":"1","title":"Electra (18) [F]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6544","display_name":"Amanda Friday"}]},{"id":"308147","section_number":"2","title":"Evarista (50) [F]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"8923","display_name":"Sarah Terry"}]},{"id":"308148","section_number":"3","title":"Maximo (35) [M]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7079","display_name":"Chuck Williamson"}]},{"id":"308149","section_number":"4","title":"Don Salvador Pantoja (58) [M]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"308150","section_number":"5","title":"The Marquis of Ronda (58) [M]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6754","display_name":"ToddHW"}]},{"id":"308151","section_number":"6","title":"Don Leonardo Cuesta (50) [M]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"5637","display_name":"Anthony"}]},{"id":"308152","section_number":"7","title":"Don Urbano Garcia Yuste (55) [M]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"308153","section_number":"8","title":"Mariano, assistant in the laboratory","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7131","display_name":"Eden Rea-Hedrick"}]},{"id":"308154","section_number":"9","title":"Gil, a mathematician","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/electra_gil_03.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4174","display_name":"Availle"}]},{"id":"308155","section_number":"10","title":"Balbina, an old servant","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"7925","display_name":"Etel Buss"}]},{"id":"308156","section_number":"11","title":"Patros, a young servant [F]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6014","display_name":"Tina Nuzzi"}]},{"id":"308157","section_number":"12","title":"Jose, an old manservant [M]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"4572","display_name":"om123"}]},{"id":"308158","section_number":"13","title":"Sister Dorotea [F]","listen_url":"https:\/\/librivox.org\/uploads\/rapunzelina\/electra_dorotea_5.mp3","language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6281","display_name":"Beth Thomas"}]},{"id":"308159","section_number":"14","title":"A Workman [M]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"308160","section_number":"15","title":"A Shade of Eleuteria [F]","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"9001","display_name":"Mary Kay"}]},{"id":"308161","section_number":"16","title":"Narrator","listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[]},{"id":"308162","section_number":"17","title":"01 -
