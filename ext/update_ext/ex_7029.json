{"books":{"17":{"id":"7029","title":"Fasti","description":"The Fasti is a Latin poem in six books, written by Ovid and believed to have been published in 8 AD. The Fasti is  organized according to the Roman calendar and explains the origins of Roman holidays and associated customs, often through the mouths of deities and with multiple aetiologies. The poem was left unfinished when the poet was exiled to Tomis, so only the first six months of the year appear in the poem.
