{"books":{"14":{"id":"8779","title":"Passing of Ku Sui","description":"Under the pseudonym of Anthony Gilmore, Harry Bates wrote the following stories in the Hawk Carse series with Desmond W. Hall, collected in Space Hawk: The Greatest of Interplanetary Adventurers (New York: Greenberg, 1952):\n\n    \"Hawk Carse\", Astounding, November, 1931\n\n    \"The Affair of the Brains\", Astounding, March, 1932\n\n    \"The Bluff of the Hawk\", Astounding, May, 1932\n\n    \"The Passing of Ku Sui\", Astounding, November, 1932\n\nBoucher and McComas described the 1952 collection as \"strongly commended to all connoisseurs of prose so outrageously bad as to reach its own kind of greatness.\" P. Schuyler Miller described the stories as \"space opera of the old, raw, gloves-off school [including] every cliche of the period,\" concluding \"Hawk Carse was so bad that he was almost good.\" Everett F. Bleiler characterized the series as \"traditional pulp Western stories transplanted into space, with the addition of an Oriental villain in the mode of Sax Rohmer's Dr. Fu-Manchu.\"\n\nTen years later, Amazing Stories printed the final Hawk Carse novelette, The Return of Hawk Carse, written by Bates alone. This story has never been collected or reprinted.\n\n    \"The Return of Hawk Carse\", Amazing, July, 1942\n - Summary by Wikipedia","url_text_source":"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/30303","language":"English","copyright_year":"1932","num_sections":"15","url_rss":"http:\/\/librivox.org\/rss\/8779","url_zip_file":"","url_project":"","url_librivox":"","url_other":null,"totaltime":"","totaltimesecs":0,"authors":[{"id":"6327","first_name":" Harry","last_name":"Bates","dob":"1900","dod":"1981"}],"url_iarchive":"","sections":[{"id":"308609","section_number":"1","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308610","section_number":"2","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308611","section_number":"3","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308612","section_number":"4","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308613","section_number":"5","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308614","section_number":"6","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308615","section_number":"7","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308616","section_number":"8","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308617","section_number":"9","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308618","section_number":"10","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308619","section_number":"11","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308620","section_number":"12","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308621","section_number":"13","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308622","section_number":"14","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]},{"id":"308623","section_number":"15","title":null,"listen_url":null,"language":"English","playtime":"0","file_name":null,"readers":[{"reader_id":"6399","display_name":"Edmund Bloxam"}]}],"genres":[{"id":"54","name":"Published 1900 onward"}],"translators":[]}}}
